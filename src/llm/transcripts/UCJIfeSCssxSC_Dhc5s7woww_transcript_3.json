        "text": " We talked about programming quite a bit and a lot of folks that are developers are really worried about their jobs about their about the future of programming Do you think AI replaces programmers completely human programmers i I mean we're definitely going in that direction Programming is just a part of building products So maybe maybe I does replace programmers eventually but there's so much more to that art Like what do you actually want to build How should it feel How's the architecture I don't think Asians will replace all of that Yeah, like just the actual art of programming it will it will stay there but it's it's going to be like knitting you know like people do that because they like it not because it makes any sense So, so I read this article this morning about someone that it's okay to mourn our craft and I can a part of me very strongly resonates with that because in my past I I spent a lot of time tinkering just being really deep in the flow and just like cranking out code and like finding really beautiful solutions and yes in a way it's It's sad because that will go away And I also got a lot of joy out of just writing code and being really deep in my thoughts and forgetting time and space and just being in this beautiful state of flow But you can get the same state of flow I get a similar state of flow by working with agents and building and thinking really hard about problems It is different but and it's okay to mourn it but that's not something we can fight like there is the world for a long time had a there was a lack of intelligence if you if you see it like that of people building things and that's why salaries of software developers reached stupidly high amounts and they will go away Um there will still be a lot of demand for people that understand how to build things just that all this tokenized intelligence uh enables people to do a lot more a lot faster and it will be even more even faster and even more because those things are continuously improving i sighs and gasps i Um, we had similar things when I it's probably not a perfect analogy but when we created the steam engine and they built all these factories and replaced a lot of manual labor and then people revolted and broke the machines Um I I can relate that if you very deeply identify that you are a programmer that it's scary and that it threatening because what you like and what you're really good at is now being done by sighs a soulless or not entity But I don't think you're just a programmer That that's a very limiting view of your craft You are you are still a builders",

Yeah. laughter Like like to understand what is the thing you need you the agent need to do this task the best I think at some point it's just going to be called coding again and it's just going to be the new normal i Yeah. snorts i And yet while I don't write the code I very much feel like I'm in the driver's seat and I am I am writing the code you know It's just i you'll still be a programmer It's just the activity of a programmer is is different i Yeah. And because on X the bubble I mean is mostly positive on on Master Done and Blue Sky. I don't I also use it less because often times I got attacked for my blog posts and I I had stronger reaction in the past Now I can sympathize with those people more cut in a way I get it It in a way I also don't get it because it's very unfair to grab onto the person that you see right now and unload all your fear and hate It's going to be a change and it's going to be challenging but it's also I don't know I find it incredibly fun and and gratifying and I can I can use the new time to focus on much more details I think the level of",

And my whole motivation was to push people away from don't see yourself as an iOS developer anymore you're now a builder and you can use your skills in many more ways also because apes are slowly going away Uh people didn't like that Like uh a lot of people didn't like what I had to say And I don't think I was hyperbole I was just like this is how I see the future Maybe this is not how it's going to be But I'm pretty sure a version of that will happen And the first question I got was \"Yeah, but what about the insane water use on data centers But then you actually sit down and do the math And then for most people if you just skip one burger per months that compensates the the CO2 output or like the water use in equivalent of tokens I mean the masses is the mass is tricky and it depends if you add pre-training, then maybe it's more than just one petty but it's not off by a factor of 100, you know So, so there well like golf is still using way more water than all data centers together So are you also hating people that play golf Those people grab on anything that they think is bad about AI without seeing the potential things that might be good about AI. i Mhm. i And I'm not saying everything is good It's certainly going to be a very transformation technology for our society There's I to steal man the the criticism in general I do want to say in my experience with Silicon Valley um there's a bit of a bubble in the sense that there's a kind of excitement and an overfocus about the positive that the technology can bring i Yeah. i And which is great It's great to focus on not to not to be paralyzed by fear and fearongering and so on But there's also within that excitement and within everybody talking just to each other there's a dismissal of the basic human experience across the United States, in the Midwest, across the world including the programmers we mentioned including all the people that are going to lose their jobs including the the the immeasurable pain and suffering that",

Just imagine all these people building especially as you make it simpler and simpler more secure It's like anybody who has ideas that can express those ideas in language can build That's crazy i Yeah. That's ultimately power to the people and one of the beauty the beautiful things that come out of AI. Not just not just a slop generator laughter i Well, Mr. Claw Father, I just realized when I said that in the beginning I violated two trademarks cut there's also the Godfather. I'm getting sued by everybody Um, you're a wonderful human being uh you've created something really special a special community a special product a special set of ideas plus the entire the humor the good vibes the inspiration of all these people building the excitement to build Uh so I'm truly grateful for everything you've been doing and uh for who you are and for sitting down to talk with me today Thank you brother i Thanks for giving me the chance to tell my story",
