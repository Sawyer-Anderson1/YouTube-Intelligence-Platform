        "text": " I'm having an issue with my plasma table. Could you please advise what the problem might be? Sure. To fix it, just open up your drawing file and check what layers you actually have. I'm a steelworker, not an IT guy. Reno Salvage has been around for 80 plus years. You wonder what happens to all the junk? Here it is, dude. My grandfather started the business, and we always did everything on paper. It's a little cringeworthy. We have to change this now. With so many antiquated processes, there's always time lost. So I'm modernizing my office. Can you create a part numbering system that's easy for my guys in the shop to remember? 1001 part numbers. It would have taken weeks for me to number this, and it would have made me go cross-eyed. Can I get three pieces at six foot? Yeah, absolutely. That's something we can do for you. And now on the current system, it\u2019d take 30 seconds. If you could log my last sales call to Reuben at Sparks Trailer Repair. Absolutely. I've got that logged for you. In a company as small as Reno Salvage, I wear a lot of hats. The maintenance guy, the sales guy, the mentor. So how's that pilot's license coming, man? It's hard, dude. It's a lot of information for me. Customers from all different industries walk through my door. There is no way that I can know all the answers, but we can find them real quick. We're going to make these out of quarter. Okay. We've never done this before, but I know we can figure it out. Yeah. Can you help me figure something out? Absolutely. Since you've got the AISC standard file uploaded, I can reference that. When I'm trying to have it teach me something, I'll actually tell it to act as a teacher. Minimum total flight time required by FAA is 40 hours, B. You got this, bro. I got this. And then I'm going to lose you. And then I got to figure out somebody else to teach things to. You\u2019re making me tear up.",
