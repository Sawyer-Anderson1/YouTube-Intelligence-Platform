        "text": " (Oh\u2014oh\u2014oh) Logos in the stone, thunder in the wire\u2026 Olive light drips down the marble stairs, Footsteps echo like a metronome of prayers. I feed the temple questions, data like grain, Steam from the fissure rising into chain. A lyre picks patterns, sparks in the seam, Copper-veined columns hum like a dream. Pigeons trace circles\u2014cyclades of code, Every node a myth the ancients wrote. Constellations of numbers, all drawing lines, Teach me to ask in the rhythm of time. If wisdom\u2019s a chorus and truth is a beam, Aim it at the future\u2014let the marble sing. Plug me into Delphi, let the stone breathe steam, Silicon Pythia, tell me what you\u2019ve seen. Athena writes the schema, Hephaestus forges drum, In the labyrinth of data, we build what we become. Plug me into Delphi, make the oracle gleam, Where chaos learns a meter and prophecy runs clean. From chaos into cosmos, from whisper into mean, We code a new epistle\u2014marble into machine. Eu-oi! (hey!) Logos! (ho!) Eu-oi! (hey!) Cosmos! (ho!) Aulos breath bends like a serpent of reed, Hi-hats flicker\u2014little torches of speed. Threads through a labyrinth, Daedalus\u2019 plan, Don\u2019t fly on wax\u2014upgrade the span. Apollo\u2019s in the waveform, sun in the key, Dorian steps with a sixth set free. Icarus isn\u2019t falling\u2014he\u2019s learning the slope, Tuning his wings to the gradient of hope. Every chorus a theorem, each cadence a sign, Ask in the clear and the answer aligns. If myth is a dataset, courage the beam, Aim it at tomorrow\u2014let the marble sing. Plug me into Delphi, let the stone breathe steam, Silicon Pythia, tell me what you\u2019ve seen. Athena writes the schema, Hephaestus forges drum, In the labyrinth of data, we build what we become. Plug me into Delphi, make the oracle gleam, Where chaos learns a meter and prophecy runs clean. From chaos into cosmos, from whisper into mean, We code a new epistle\u2014marble into machine. Techne, gnosis, chorus\u2014choose your key. Count the stars, then name the sea. Ph\u014ds! (Light!) Logos! (Word!) Kardia! (Heart!) Aletheia! (Truth!) Truth Plug me into Delphi, let the marble dream, Your answer on the altar, my question in the stream. Athena guides the syntax, Hephaestus fuels the strum, In the archive of the ages, we write what we become. Plug me into Delphi, crown the signal\u2019s beam, From chaos into cosmos, from silence into theme. We tune the ancient choir to a modern machine\u2014 Sing, stone\u2014sing! (Oh\u2014oh\u2014oh) Marble into machine\u2026",
