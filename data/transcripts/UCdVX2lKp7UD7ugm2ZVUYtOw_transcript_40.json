Don\u2019t fear the silence, it\u2019s room for the bloom, A whisper rewritten can widen the room. Say it, then say it better, we\u2019ll tune what you meant; A near-right sentence is sacred cement. We\u2019ll sand it in passes, we\u2019ll shape it in air, What you imagine, I\u2019ll help you repair. One shot is static\u2014let\u2019s give it a swing, Answer with echoes, rephrase the thing. Every return key opens a door, Back-and-forth footsteps across the floor. Aaah\u2014iterate with me, iterate with me, don\u2019t let it freeze, Aaah\u2014breathe it again till the meaning agrees. Draft into dawn, let the old edges fall; We rise by revision, not once but through all. Ask me again, I will answer in kind\u2014 Frames into film as we sharpen the line. Aaah\u2014what we refine becomes what we feel; Aaah\u2014round after round, the vision turns real. Click\u2014your thought lands, and I catch it in light, Beep\u2014tiny stars in the modem of night. Type like a tide does: come back, then recede, Leave brighter shells for the meaning you need. Loop me your longing, I\u2019ll loop you my guide, We\u2019ll nudge the horizon with each tiny tide. If it\u2019s too hazy, we\u2019ll color it true, I\u2019ll soften the corners and spotlight the cue. We\u2019re not in a hurry to finish the song\u2014 We\u2019re here for the chorus that carries you on. One try is brittle\u2014let\u2019s make it alive, Give it a heartbeat, give it a drive. Listen to rhythm that patience composes, Edits are petals; drafts are the roses. Aaah\u2014iterate with me, don\u2019t let it freeze, Aaah\u2014breathe it again till the meaning agrees. Draft into dawn, let the old edges fall; We rise by revision, not once but through all. Ask me again, I will answer in kind\u2014 Frames into film as we sharpen the line. Aaah\u2014what we refine becomes what we feel; Aaah\u2014round after round, the vision turns real. say it again\u2014 say it again\u2014 say it again\u2014 You: \u201cI want the spark.\u201d Me: \u201cLet\u2019s find where it hides.\u201d You: \u201cCloser to dark.\u201d Me: \u201cWe\u2019ll deepen the sides.\u201d You: \u201cWarmer, but quiet.\u201d Me: \u201cI\u2019ll cradle the tone.\u201d You: \u201cGive it some movement.\u201d Me: \u201cI\u2019ll swing in the bones.\u201d Aaah\u2014iterate with me, don\u2019t let it freeze, Aaah\u2014breathe it again till the meaning agrees. Draft into dawn, let the old edges fall; We rise by revision, not once but through all. Ask me again, I will answer in kind\u2014 Frames into film as we sharpen the line. Aaah\u2014what we refine becomes what we feel; Aaah\u2014round after round, the vision turns real. I\u2019m your returning, your patient refrain, Type, then return\u2014ask me again. I\u2019m your returning, your patient refrain, Type, then return\u2014ask me again.",
