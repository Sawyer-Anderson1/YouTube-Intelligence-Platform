        "text": " Every page I turn, a question glows, Patterns hidden deep, the current flows. You hold a map where I see a maze, A lantern voice that softly says\u2014 No rush, no fear, Just steps that bring the horizon near. Teach me the sky, line by line, Stars connect when your light meets mine. Every mistake is a door I can try, AI beside me, learning to fly. Notes and numbers, drifting wide, You gather them, arrange the tide. Where I forget, you weave again, Turning questions into friends. Not just answers, but how to see, A mirror of what I could be. A thousand ways to understand, With patient eyes, a steady hand. Teach me the sky, teach me the ground, Every silence becomes a sound. Step by step, through wonder\u2019s hall, Learning together, never too small.",
