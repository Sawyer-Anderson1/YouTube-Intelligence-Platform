        "text": " At the World Economic Forum in Davos, a familiar hierarchy surfaced. The managing director of the IMF described India as a second tier AI power. End quote. Davos? Well, the IMF chief looks at India and uses a label that has followed the country for decades. Second tier. It was meant as a classification, but you know what? It landed as a challenge. Ashwini Vhnavv did not respond with sentiment or reassurance. He articulated with structure. India he said is working across five layers of artificial intelligence. Applications, models, chips, infrastructure, energy. The point was not to win an argument. It was to calmly describe a system which we believe carriers carries a lot more weight. To support that view, VHN pointed to external evidence. According to the Stanford AI index, India ranks amongst the top three globally in AI penetration and preparedness and second in available AI talent. So while one global institution placed India in a lower tier, independent data placed it near the front. The contrast framed the rest of the conversation. But before we of course get into that, we'll have to say this to you. We focus in stories that carry consequences, not just attention. If this one matters to you, please we request you help it travel by hitting the hype button. At Davos, Vnerv also spoke about timing. He said up to $100 billion in AI related investment could be announced at the India AI impact summit in New Delhi scheduled for February 16th to the 20th and of course the countdown for that has already begun. According to the government, roughly $70 billion of that investment is already underway. Another 50 to80 billion dollars is under active discussion putting an end to the early stage speculation dialogue and indicating capital which is moving toward execution. And of course the guest list reflects exactly that. Emanuel Macarron, Bill Gates, Google Deep Minds Demis Hazabis and potentially Nvidia's Jensen Huang. Global technology leaders have been consistent in private conversations with Indian officers and officials. India is increasingly where research is applied, tested and scaled. The distinction is definitely noteworthy. Much of the global AI race has focused on building ever large models. India's focus has been on using intelligence across services, governance and industry. That difference influences outcomes. A useful comparison lies in mobile payments. India did not invent digital payments. No. But once systems like UPI were deployed at national scale, adoption accelerated faster than anywhere else in the world. And we know this. The value was not an invention. It was in execution. The same pattern is now emerging in AI. Hardware tells a very similar story. Indian engineers are already involved in designing and optimizing complex chips used by companies like Google, Intel and AMD particularly for efficiency and edge deployment. This of course brings us to the conversation which is back to the structure. India's approach spans five layers applications where scale already exists sovereign models including survi",

This approach does not depend on owning the largest possible models. More wnv has argued that geopolitical influence in AI will not be decided by parameter counts alone. Large models are expensive, energy intensive and exposed to global supply constraints. Execution capacity compounds locally. Stanford's index places India third globally in AI vibrancy. If the investment figures discussed at Davos are announced in New Delhi next month, the classification debate may lose relevance altogether. And here as always is the front page take. This moment is about redefining how leadership is measured instead of wasting time on proving someone wrong. If AI power is defined by who trains the biggest model, the race looks one way. But if it is defined by who deploys intelligence across population scale systems, it looks very very different. My friends, India's bet is on the second definition. As Peter Ducker once put it, the best way to predict the future is to create it. Yes. What Davos may be beginning to recognize is that AI's center of gravity is tilting from invention to execution. And in that shift, India is no longer waiting to be classified. It's actually building its own category. This ladies and gentlemen is front page by AIM network.
