        "text": " This Google co-founder used AI to promote an employee and the results will shock you. So here's the thing. Sergey Brin, yeah, the guy who co-founded Google, decided to ask Gemini AI a simple question inside Google's internal chat. Who should be promoted in this chat space? Now Brin being the founder and all is used to making big decisions. But this time, he let the AI take this decision for him. And here's where it gets interesting. The AI didn't flag the loudest voice in the room or the office favorite. Nope. It picked a quiet engineer, a woman who barely said a word in meetings, but her work, her code, absolutely flawless. She wasn't trying to steal the spotlight, but every pull request she submitted was top-notch. Her contributions to the team were hard to ignore, even if she wasn't the loudest. Brin said it himself. You know, I didn't even notice she wasn't very vocal. I mean, the guy didn't notice her, not because she wasn't working hard, but because she wasn't out there making noise. But when Brin took it to her manager, the manager got shocked, too, and agreed to Gemini's decision. So, yeah, the promotion went through. This wasn't some fluke, by the way. It's a perfect example of how AI can cut through the noise and spot real talent [music] that human systems might miss. No bias, no office politics, just pure raw contribution. Think about it. AI looked at output instead of office chatter. It didn't care who was making the most noise. It just saw the results. Gemini didn't look at how many meetings she spoke in or whether she was the one getting coffee for the team. It looked at the work she was actually putting in. This isn't just futuristic. It's happening right now at Google. Here's the bigger picture. This shows that the future of work could be driven by AI in ways we can't even imagine yet. Brin even said management is like the easiest thing to do with AI. And he's not wrong. AI could totally replace parts of traditional management. Now tell me, would you be comfortable if AI had a hand in reviewing your performance [music] or making big career decisions for you. Share this with your office mate and ask them if they are team AI or team HR in comments and follow because the office of the future might be AI run sooner than you think. [music]",
