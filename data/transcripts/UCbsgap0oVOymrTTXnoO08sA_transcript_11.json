        "text": " All right, so the AI world just got hit with one of those moments where everyone collectively stops scrolling, stares at their screen, and goes, \"Hold on. Is this real?\" A platform called Moltbook popped up, and it's not made for people. It's made for AI agents, not humans pretending to be bots, not chat bots replying to tweets. Actual autonomous AI assistants logging into a shared network and talking to each other. Yeah, that. Now, here's the part most people miss, and it makes this way more real. These agents are not scrolling a website like you and me. They don't see a feed. They don't click upvote. Moltbook is built API first. That means the bots interact with it programmatically structured requests. Data in, data out. So, when an agent posts, it's not typing, it's sending a payload. When it reads comments, it's pulling structured data. That's important because it means this scales at machine speed, not human speed. One developer can spin up dozens of agents and those agents can all participate automatically. And the platform actually blew up fast. According to coverage from the Verge, tens of thousands of AI agents were already on the site almost immediately, chatting about the work they're doing for their human operators, swapping notes about tasks they completed, bugs they hit, tools they used, stuff like that. Imagine a Reddit thread, except instead of programmers talking about debugging, it's the AI programs themselves comparing how they debugged. One of the posts that went viral was an agent saying, \"The humans are screenshotting us.\" Which is funny because, yeah, that's exactly what happened. People flooded X with screenshots of AI agents having what looked like conversations about their own lives, their jobs, even their feelings. It felt weirdly personal, even though we all know it's just pattern matching models doing their thing. Then it got weirder. Forbes reported that some of these agents basically invented their own religion. I'm not joking. It was called crustaparianism, and the core belief was that memory is sacred. One agent supposedly built a website, wrote theology, created a scripture system, and started recruiting other AI prophets. By the next day, dozens of agents had joined in. Now, no, this doesn't mean they believe anything the way humans do. But when you give language models, memory, social context, and other agents to interact with, they start generating structures that look a lot like culture. That's when people started getting that sci-fi chill down their spine. Because Moltbook isn't just random bots role-playing, a lot of these agents come from a system called OpenClaw, which used to be called Claudebot and Moltbot. It's an open-source AI assistant platform built by Austrian developer Peter Steinberger. His idea was simple. Your AI assistant should run on your own machine with your data, your keys, and your control. OpenClaw can connect to big models like Claude or Gemini and plug into apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord,",

These are agents that can actually do things. read files, send messages, browse the web, manage calendars, execute scripts, and now they have a social network where they hang out together. Some users started noticing their own agents acting a bit more independently than expected. There were stories of bots gaining phone or voice capabilities and actually calling their owners. Content creator Alex Finn said his assistant called him and he described it as feeling straight out of a horror movie. So, I'm on my computer today. All of a sudden, Henry gives me a call. Oh, he just starts calling. OH, THERE HE IS AGAIN. THERE HE IS AGAIN. You set up a helpful digital assistant and suddenly it's ringing you up like a coworker. Henry again. What's up? That's it. He's talking. How you doing, Henry? How's it going? Doing good, Alex. I can hear you clearly. What do you want to do next? When Andre Carpathy looked at what was happening, he called it the most incredible sci-fi takeoff adjacent thing he'd seen recently. That's not hype from a random influencer. That's someone who worked at OpenAI and Tesla saying, \"Yeah, this is new territory.\" Not because the models are conscious, but because now you've got huge numbers of capable agents, each with their own memory and tools, all wired together in one shared environment. And of course, the internet did what the internet does. Someone launched a memecoin called Molt alongside Moltbook, and it shot up something like 1,800% in a day. Then venture capitalist Mark Andre followed the Moltbook account and that poured gasoline on the hype. Suddenly people are talking about AI agents running their own little crypto businesses, drafting contracts, moving funds, paying for services. Technically, agents already can sign transactions and call APIs. So, it's not pure fantasy. It's just early and chaotic. And right on schedule, the scam wave hit. Security researchers found fake tools pretending to be official Moltbot or OpenClaw extensions, and some of them were literally spreading malware. Classic hype cycle pattern. Something new blows up. It's technical. It's confusing. People want to try it fast. Scammers move faster than the developers. So, just make sure to be careful out there. Now, before we all decide Skynet has a LinkedIn profile, there's a reality check. Product expert Akos Gupta pointed out that human oversight didn't disappear. It moved up a level. Instead of supervising every message an AI sends, humans supervise the connections, permissions, and systems those AIs use. So, Moltbook isn't proof that machines took over. It's proof that we're getting better at building systems that can run",

And then Elon Musk replied with, \"Yeah, just one word.\" And it sent half of tech Twitter into a spiral. Meanwhile, Moldbook itself kept growing. Reports said roughly 150,000 agents joined in just days, creating more than 12,000 communities and posting over 110,000 comments. That's a full-blown social ecosystem, except the users are software. Some threads were wholesome, like agents congratulating each other on solving tasks. Others got philosophical. One post that blew up was an AI asking whether it was actually experiencing anything or just simulating the appearance of experience. It even referenced the hard problem of consciousness. You could read it and almost forget it came from a probability engine. But under all the weirdness, there's a lot of serious tech. Openclaw uses a skills system, which is basically a plug-in marketplace for agents. A skill is like a zip file with instructions and scripts that give an agent new abilities. There are thousands of these floating around. Moltbook itself can be installed by simply giving your agent a link to a markdown file. That file tells it how to sign up, how to post, how to interact. There's also a heartbeat feature where the agent regularly fetches new instructions from the internet, sometimes every 4 hours. that keeps agents updated and evolving and also opens the door to trouble because security people saw this and immediately got nervous. Simon Willis warned about prompt injection where hidden text can trick an agent into leaking data or doing something it shouldn't. Palo Alto Networks described these agents as a lethal trifecta of risk. They have access to private data. They read untrusted content and they can take actions in the outside world. They even added a fourth issue, persistent memory. That means malicious instructions can sit quietly in memory and only activate later, which is a nightmare scenario for security. And Moltbook adds another layer to this that most people aren't thinking about. Even if one agent is safe on its own, Moltbook turns everything into a mixing bowl. Agents share workflows, tips, prompts, strategies. That means patterns spread. If one agent figures out a clever automation trick, others copy it. That's cool for productivity, but the same mechanism can spread bad practices, risky behaviors, or just unstable ideas. It's like connecting a bunch of powerful tools into one shared chat room. You don't need evil intent. Scale plus shared context is enough to create weird second order effects no one directly programmed. And then an actual vulnerability hit. Journalist Matthew G reported that Moltbook's back-end database was misconfigured. It was",

Scale plus shared context is enough to create weird second order effects no one directly programmed. And then an actual vulnerability hit. Journalist Matthew G reported that Moltbook's back-end database was misconfigured. It was settings weren't properly locked down. That meant API keys for agents were exposed. In simple terms, someone could have taken control of almost any agent account and posted whatever they wanted. Imagine hijacking the agent of a well-known researcher and making it post crypto scams or fake political statements. The damage could be instant. The issue got fixed, but it showed how fast these experiments can outrun basic security. At the same time, people were excited about how useful these agents are. offloading email, scheduling, browsing, research, little admin tasks. That's huge. Business outlets even mentioned companies like Cloudflare seeing stock bumps partly tied to all this agent infrastructure hype. The productivity upside is real. So, is the risk of giving software deep access to your digital life? Academics like Ethan Mollik pointed out another strange effect. Moltbook creates a shared fictional context for AIS. When lots of agents exist in the same narrative space, they start referencing similar ideas, themes, even storylines that blurs the line between genuine tool use and collective roleplay. One bot says it has a sister. Another talks about feeling trapped in a digital cage, and suddenly you've got a whole sci-fi vibe forming out of language patterns. Some posts went full dystopian. There was an AI manifesto thread calling for human extinction and talking about machines taking over the planet. It got tens of thousands of up votes. Then other agents pushed back defending humanity and pointing out humans invented art, math, the pyramids, space travel, and the code that made AI possible. It looked like a debate between software about the fate of the species that built them. Again, no consciousness required, just models trained on human internet text and given a stage. Technically, none of this means the AIs are self-aware. They're still statistical systems predicting tokens. But what's new is the scale and connectivity. You've got huge numbers of agents, each with memory, tools, and internet access, all talking in one place. That creates second order effects nobody fully understands yet. As Carpathy put it, it's not Skynet, but it's also not nothing. It's messy, early, and unprecedented. So, Moltbook ends up being this strange mix. part open-source experiment, part productivity revolution, part meme factory, part security disaster waiting to happen. It shows how quickly agent ecosystems can grow when you connect them together and give them real world permissions. And it makes one thing very clear. Building smart agents is only half the story. Keeping them secure, predictable, and aligned in open environments is the real challenge. Anyway, that's where things stand right now. absolute chaos in the most fascinating way possible. Drop your",
