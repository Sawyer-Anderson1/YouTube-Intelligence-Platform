        "text": " So this guy just solved one of the hardest math problems on Earth. It's from the Aerodos problems and he actually used artificial intelligence to do it. It's pretty insane. Chad GPT 5.2 prompted was able to solve a math problem that really only a few hundred people in the world can solve. It was submitted to Terren Tao who is the best mathematician on earth and it was accepted. And here's the crazy part. This was the sixth one in the last two weeks. AI is accelerating so fast. It is now able to solve some of the hardest open math problems on Earth. The implications for this are enormous. If artificial intelligence is able to solve the hardest math problems, maybe it's able to come up with more efficient or better algorithms for itself. And then it can apply that improvement to itself. And then we have something called the intelligence explosion. That is self-improving artificial intelligence. Apply all of that intelligence to solving all disease, maybe curing cancer, allowing us to come up with new materials. This is a bigger deal than I think most people appreciate. Neil Samani is very smart. He's a quantitative researcher. But it's only with the help of artificial intelligence. and Chad GPT over the course of 15 minutes he was able to solve this incredibly hard math problem. This might be the beginning of the intelligence explosion.",
