Of course, you go to the doctor and they prescribe the anti-inflammatory medication. I wanted to augment that with as many natural things as I could with ChatGPT. You said you already have this in the garden. Virtually every single one of the herbs are anti-inflammatory. It knows what I have in the house. What I have in the garden. It knows the restaurants that I go to the most. It'll say, if you're going here, this is what you want to get.
