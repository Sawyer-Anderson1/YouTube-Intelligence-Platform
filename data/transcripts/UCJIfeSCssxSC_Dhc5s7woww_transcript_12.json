        "text": " So I think uh one useful lens to look at all of this through is the deepseek so-called deepseek moment This happened about a year ago in January 2025 when the overweight Chinese company Deepseek released Deepseek R1 that uh I think it's fair to say surprised everyone with uh near or at state-of-the-art performance with allegedly much less compute for much cheaper and from then to today the AI competition has gotten insane both on the research level and the product level it's just been accelerating Let's discuss all this today and maybe let's start with some spicy questions if we can laughter Uh who's winning at the international level Would you say it's the set of companies in China or the set of companies in the United States? And Sebastian, Nathan, it's good to see you guys Uh so Sebastian, who do you think is winning i Um so winning is a very broad uh you know terms I I would say you mentioned the deepseek moment and I do think deepseek is definitely winning the hearts of the people who work on open weight models because they share these as open models Um winning I think has multiple time scales to it We have today we have next year we have in 10 years One thing I know for sure is that um I don't think nowadays 2026 that there will be any company who is let's say having access to a technology that no other company has access to And that is mainly because researchers are frequently changing jobs changing labs they rotate So I don't think there will be a clear winner in terms of technology access However, I do think there will be uh the differentiating factor will be budget and hardware constraints So I don't think the ideas will be proprietary but the way or the resources that are needed to implement them and so I don't see currently take it all scenario where a winner takes it all I can't see that at the moment i Uh Nathan, what do you think you see the labs put different energy into what they're trying to do and I think to demarcate the point in time when we're recording this um the hype over Anthropics Cloud Opus 4.5 model has been absolutely insane which is just I mean I've used it I've built stuff in the last few weeks and it's it's almost gotten to the point where it feels like a bit of a meme in terms of the hype and it's kind of funny because this is very organic and then if we go back a few months ago we can get the release date and the notes is Gemini 3 from Google got released and it seemed like the marketing and just like wow factor of that release was super high But then at the end of November, Claude Opus 4.5 was released and the hype has been growing",

So Deep Seek kicked off a movement within China. I say kind of similar to how Chad GBT kicked off a movement in the US where everything had a chatbot. There's now tons of teach companies in China that are releasing very strong frontier overweight models to the point where I would say that Deep Seek is kind of losing its crown as the preeminent open model maker in China. and the likes of um Z.aiis with their GLM models Miniaax's models um Kimmy Moonshot, especially in the last few months have shown more brightly The new Deep Seek models are still very strong but that's kind of a it could look back as a big narrative point where 2025 Deep Seek came and then all and it kind of provided this platform for way more Chinese companies that are releasing these fantastic models to kind of have this new type of operation So these models from these Chinese companies are open weights and depending on the trajectory of business models that these American companies are doing could be at risk but currently a lot of people are paying for AI software in the US and historically in China and other parts of the world people don't pay a lot for software i So some of these models like deepseek uh have the love of the people because they are open weight How long do you think the Chinese companies keep releasing overweight models i I would say for a few years I think that like in the US there's not a clear business model for it I have been",

For example you mentioned Kimmy, same architecture They're training it And then again we have this leapfrogging where they might be at some point in time a bit better because they have the more recent model And I think this comes back to the the fact that there won't be a clear winner It's it will just be like like that and one person releases something the other one comes in And the the recent the most recent model is probably always the best model i Yeah. We'll also see the Chinese companies have different incentives So like Deepseek is very secretive where some of these startups are like the Miniaxes and Z.AI of the world Those two literally have filed IPO paperwork and they're trying to get Western Mind Share and do a lot of outreach there So I don't know if these incentives will kind of change the model development cut Deep See famously is built by a hedge fund Highflyier Capital, and we don't know exactly what they like We don't know what they use the models for or if they care about this i They're secret in terms of communication And they're not secret in",
