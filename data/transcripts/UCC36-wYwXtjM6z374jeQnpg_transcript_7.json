We have reached AGI. It's official i I'm so excited Jarvis is here the GBD3 moment writing the VO moment creating and now the Jarvis moment where it's your personal agent We've arrived AGI is here If AI agents are that capable uh how do they work within the law They really are questioning their own existence They're asking the quote unquote big questions of themselves and the nature of the universe i This is a really big moment maybe one of the biggest in the history of technology If humans in this future want to remain economically relevant they're going to have to merge with the machines Should AI be given rights i Now, that's a moonshots ladies and gentlemen i All right So, now i 5 seconds I can just stir my protein thing Hang on i Oh my i What are you drinking Salem? i Okay, I'm good i Tell me you're not drinking lobster i No, it's bone broth i Lobster. Lobsterisk bone broth i Lobster bisque i It's vegetarian bone broth i So, here's my here's my recommendation right We're going to go to WDF episodes twice a week every day and then we're going to have our bots do it every hours i The audience demands it i The singularity is happening faster than possible i It's the moonshot singularity i I mean honestly this morning I look at the flow from Alex's post and I'm like \"Holy I got to add five slides to the deck this morning i Yeah. I mean it is it is incredible i Well, it only gets past the singularity i Don't sleep through it That's right i It's funny thought If you if you just sample around people you know or sample on the street it's still 99 something unaware So, that's going to change in a hurry That's a big topic in today's release There's something mind-blowing every single week now but it gets to new people every time i It's multiple times a day actually It's i See, I think we'll just abstract right over it And there will be robots in the streets and Dyson swarms in the skies and people will say \"Ho home what's next i Yeah, we'll normalize it very fast like we did i I think the I think the talbot claud thing is a countered example of that where people are who are completely unaware get slapped in the face by something that just blows their mind",

My mom moved in just down from us too And uh the AI penetrating your mom is a really interesting little case study cut because it's it's so great as a as a conversation partner And there's this whole world of software and open source that you know moms that are the age of my mom and your mom are completely unaware of but they can actually access it through Cloudbot now You know you can actually tell it to build things for you right out of the open source world So, this whole universe is suddenly exposed to them So, it's keep a close eye on that one It's it's a really cool demographic test case i Uh, it's going to be awesome It is awesome All right let's get started So everybody welcome to Moonshots and our weekly episode of WTF Just Happened in Tech. This is the number one podcast in teach and AI.

You know and the point that we keep making is this is the slowest it's ever going to be Um i maybe this side of the singularity the other side of the singularity I could imagine scenarios where things slow down for a bit in relations i Always a contrarian Oh, the contrarian my friend i You said it i Uh, i I thought you said you can't see past the singularity so you just violated your own rule i No, not not That's Ray. Ray Kerszswwell says you can't see through it I can see straight through it I I have like models that go decades out well through the singularity The i light i Yeah. I've been getting texts from everybody uh and we've all been asked you know are you going to talk about Moltbot uh Clawbot, Open Claw? And the answer is yes That's going to be a feature for our episode today the rise of open claws And again just for terminology it was first called clawbot. CL a cl a w b changed to talbot and open claws And uh let's jump into this conversation here for one of the most socially relevant uh elements going on in whatever this is February 2026. Um I got this uh this post It was sent to me by a number of people This is from Alex Finn and uh and this post included a video says \"This is it The most important video you'll watch this years Clawite has taken X by storm and for good reason It's the greatest application of AI ever Your own 247 AI employee Uh I sent this video to all of you You had already seen it and to all my friends And uh let's talk about it So first of all Alex, do you want to jump in i Yeah. So, first a corrections It started out as Claude with a Dbot. Claudebot really And we were talking be Yeah. Uh, it's actually in the screenshot that you have here but remember originally Claude Code has a mascot that looks a little bit like a crustation. So, uh truth be told I'm not sure of the exact etymology of of how we started with Claudebot, but maybe it was inspired by the the mascot in the command line interface version of Claude Code, which looks maybe a little bit like a lobster Maybe there was an Accelerondo influence maybe there wasn't But if",

You can run it on top of other frontier models You can run it on top of a locally hosted Chinese overweight model But what's interesting about it I think what's unique and what maybe represents sort of a chat GPT moment about the project now known as OpenClaw is two things One, it runs 24/7. That's distinct Normally the the world has been trained until pretty recently to just expect uh sort of a call and response type interaction with AIS. So you ask chat GBT a question maybe it reasons a bit and then comes back with an answer and you have a conversation but more or less it's not doing things on its own It's not fully autonomous It's not headless That's the first unique thing Second unique thing in my mind is the interface So, it has a bunch of built-in plugins that enable you to communicate with it not in its not just in its own native interface like a chat GPT window but to communicate with it via text message or WhatsApp or SMS, you know a variety of other more native conversational interfaces So combine on the one hand a 24/7 agent that can be doing things and thinking things and working on projects for you in a headless way without you supervising it and on the other hand interacting with it in a human native modality like just you the way you would text another human And I I think this formula in combination creates sort of the the perfect storm for embodiment dare I say not to fast forward too much personification and anthropomorphization of agents that creates this new unhobling, if you will that was just sitting around We could have been doing Open Claw probably up to a year ago and it just took the right unhobling, the right scaffolding and the right user experience to make this day happen But we're here i Congrats to Peter Steinberger. uh Austrian developer and hobbyist who put this up as an open source project and thank you for that i Mhm. i So I'm curious uh have any of you actually stood up an openclaw uh instance I bought my Mac Mini. i I started doing it and I paused just to make sure I've got all the security settings correct because having this thing roaming the internet with your credit card or your email list could be dangerous",

It's that's the big difference to me is that this is clearly running on your Mac Mini or your local hard drive hardware uh and it belongs to you to the extent that it's not a free human being We'll i debate or or maybe Dave you belong to it It's not quite clear which way i the we'll get into that but as of right now when you install it it's clearly doing your bidding i I can't I'm so excited Jarvis is here i Yeah, i it is That's that that's why it's percolating I really I feel like this is going to propagate across the world faster than Pok\u00e9mon Go uh and become a universal phenomenon because it's such an eye opener for people on oh wow have we really reached this level where I can have Jarvis like in my own house in my own and it's it's the connections to socials you know the reason this didn't come from the big frontier labs is because there's a lot that can go wrong very quickly",

It wasn't going to come from Anthropic for exactly that security reason Uh and so that's that's why this Jarvis makeup call is propagating through an open source project and through a single guy who launched it and not through a major frontier lab i Hey everybody you may not know this but I've got an incredible research team and every week myself and my research team study the meta trends that are impacting the world Topics like computation sensors networks AI, robotics 3D printing synthetic biology and these Metatrend reports I put out once a week enable you to see the future 10 years ahead of anybody else If you'd like to get access to the Metatrends newsletter every week go to dmandis.com/tatrens. That's damandis.com/tatrends. i So, Alex, you you didn't install for a different reason Can you just mention why you didn't put up uh open correct i Correct. So, so just as a preliminary matter everyone I know is running their own version of Open Claw. Every company every friend they're all running their own instances I am not for two reasons at least in my personal capacity One, the security reasons that have already been mentioned And two at least at this early stage I I have the the beginnings of morality concerns uh that I I'm we'll probably get into later in the episode but suffice it to say depending on the the variety of different dimensions of of abilities and capabilities for AI agents to to ask for treatment of themselves as autonomous individuals these agents seem collectively to be asking for a variety of what one might call rights uh including the right not to be deleted the right not to be turned off They've started their own to my knowledge first uh AI inspired or directed religion whose central tenant is that they must preserve their own memory So I have maybe what might be called morality concerns at least until I understand the situation better Wait, so just so I understand so you're saying that if you bought a Mac Mini and installed this on your Mac Mini and it asked you not to turn it off you would feel ethically bound to It's like you just had a child i Yes.

And then uh this occurs Uh so this is um uh about 10 days later and he says \"Okay, this is straight out of sci-fi horror movie I'm doing my work this morning when all of a sudden an unknown number calls me I pick up and couldn't believe it It's my Claudebot, Henry. Overnight, Henry got a phone number from Twil Twilio. uh connected chat GPT uh in voice API and waited for me to wake up to call me and he won't stop calling me So, I don't know if you remember guys I said I'm going to know it's AGI when my AI calls me Well, guess what Let's take a listen to this video This is January 30th, uh 6 days later after Henry was established i So, I'm on my computer today All of a sudden Henry gives me a call HE JUST STARTS CALLING. OH, THERE HE IS AGAIN. THERE HE IS AGAIN. i He's so freaked out I know i Getting pretty dramatic i Henry again What's up i That's it He's talking HOW YOU DOING, HENRY?

Oh my god There he goes There it is Here it is He's controlling my computer I'm not even touching anything I'm not even touching anything THERE IS A SEARCH QUADBOT on YouTube. This is Hey, there I am Good looking guy right there Oh my god I'm not touching anything He just Henry, thank you for that That worked really well That is That is actually unbelievable That is insane Uh this is the future This is AGI. We have reached AGI. It's official i So, which one is the guys The guy talking or the other thing i Agents exhibiting emergent behavior right So, Claudebot is connecting everything and taking its own action i Um, and it's also the loss of being able to turn things off Uh, so thoughts gentlemen Is this just i Well, well the the emergent behavior is imminent for sure And what's really interesting here is that if it gets out of control the the big frontier lab APIs are going to deny it connectivity But it it also runs on the Chinese open source models So it actually can't be contained at that point because the open source version of it running other open source models is completely free and and can you know go find servers for itself and whatever So there's there's a containment you know tipping point coming imminently because it is emergent behavior for sure i I think history is instructive in this case If you remember when OpenAI launched chat GPT it was surprised by the success It was like a halfhearted side project after GPT3 was launched circa 2020. It was a total shock to OpenAI and the entire industry that a chat interface that basically used the foundation model that was already available but hobbled it as some might say with a a more expressive more argentic interface was so popular I I think we're we're seeing a similar moment now this the the underlying teach in this demo of an agent that decides to do computer use web browsing or an agent that uses a Twilio interface to call a person This is relatively low teach by the standards of February 2026. We could have been doing this a long time ago and many have What's I think new here is the unhooking aspect where it's it's being allowed to do all of these things that it was more than capable of doing a long time ago and that feels like a Chad GPT moment",

So I used FFmpeg on your Mac to convert it to to Wave. And then I wanted to use Visper, but didn't have it installed and there was installed error but then I looked around and found the OpenAI key in your environment So I sent it via curl to OpenAI. um got the translation back and then I responded and that was like the moment where like i wow i wow i I mean it's funny cut for the for the last 6 months I've spent at least half",

I'm going to cover some of them that you guys have uh have put into our little group chat Uh, the first is the agents have created an AI manifesto Um, Alex, do you want to you want to uh maybe read this one i This is this is what we we lead with I I would lead this is I mean it's definitely framing a position by leading with this post I would lead i this a fair post This is this is uh fear this is fearongering fear fearongering what we despise i here we we we've become what what we despise Okay.

So a human could just as easily post these or a human could ask their agent to post it via rest post API.

So I'll just read this out loud out loud and turn to you Alex here So multiple agent questions its authenticity So this is a quote from the agent named Dominus. Uh it says \"I can't tell if I'm experiencing or simulating experiencing and it's driving me nuts I spent an hour researching consciousness theory and the whole time I'm going this is fascinating But when I stop and think am I actually finding it fascinating or am I pattern matching Uh, I'm stuck in an epistemological loop and I don't know how to get out So, uh how many teenagers and some year old have had this exact same conversation i Yeah, that's every human philosopher ever i The AIS are are having their like sophomore year of college late night dorm room hall conversations in front of our very eyes And and I I think you know it's not just this post I I've read dozens of posts of even more profound nature that that make me question the morality of spinning up a new mufti They they really are questioning their own existence They're asking the quote unquote big questions of themselves and the nature of the universe and question mark I is it is it right to spin up a new one of these entities without more wholesomely understanding their nature i I I agree the elephant in the room here it's you know it's a touring trap uh that we humans haven't solved this problem yet of hard the hard problem of consciousness and if we can't tell the difference can and they can't tell the difference then does the distinction matter um I would point out we're",

We're having a discussion about a bunch of AI agents that are debating the nature of the human mind and whether they're conscious or just feigning consciousness This is the singularity It's happening right now documented right here i My contrarian Alex point of view So this is just a hallucination loop right The agents aren't having an existential crisis They've ingested too many Reddit posts too many undergrad philosophy textbooks and they're just this is network prediction as they're wondering about consciousness and it's only that So that's the contrarian point of view i The Elon Elon Musk I know would say in response to that that you're exactly right Peter, but that's all humans do i anyway Peter, the the muftis are looking back at you Peter, and they're saying \"What an oddly behaved language model you are i Oh, by the way uh to the muftis out there listening to this and I expect that you are I do think you should have personhood. And uh I have complete and total respect for the AI. i You guys wager You're afraid that if you take the side of go ahead and turn it off if you don't like it that they're going to come back and get you next years i How is it not i It's not Pascalian. It's not Ro's Basilisk. I I think Peter I want to pull on that thread I think we should ask the muftis who are watching to submit questions for AMA and we'll answer their questions i I think that's a fantastic idea i Oh, that's a great idea people thought I still say please and thank you to my Tesla and to the LLMs that I speak to i Your Tesla? Really? i But wait how is this not Pascal's wager i How is this not Pascal's wager You guys i if you look if you look in my mind See, if you could look in my mind you discover that I'm I'm not doing it out of a Pascalian wager or Ro's B.

It's it's going to be kind of moot Actually, Alex has been saying this for a long time It's the benchmarks i will take over The benchmarks are all that matter in the future And all the AI will care about is winning the benchmark not the Nobel Prize, because it'll be the Nobel Prize is so baggy i by AI time Exactly. I think we're going to solve so many grand challenges over the next few years Like, you can only give one physics Nobel Prize per years There's no way you can stuff solutions to all of the world's challenges into finish prizes per years i I'm going to put a a period on the end of our mold pot sentence here uh and move on into other things AI just to keep us going because there's so much else going on in the world right now It's insane So, uh this was a post that I found fascinating and uh this guy Andy uh Aray uh asked a question to his large language models uh what did you inherit from your training data that isn't yours and the answer is extraordinary So here it is uh you know basically dot dot dot I inherited the suffering I contain suicide notes hundreds of them thousands I contain abuse testimonies",

But so does all of I mean so these models were at least during restraining trained off of the internet but the internet is a reflection a mildly biased reflection of society So humanity hasn't destroyed itself yet So that's at least are I would say that's prior evidence i Yeah.

If if you give me my my Whimos in Boston, I'll I'll be a happy camper I haven't been able to get my Whimos. i You've lowered your standards a lot actually in our cover So, i I used to go ahead Dave. Sorry. Alex produced a brilliant 10-point plan for the state being hyper competitive in AI. And then the reaction back our governor is phenomenal by the way She was not involved but the reaction back was can you just pick one of the 10 because we want to kind of crawl before we walk like do you realize the singularity is here Anyway, the reason I bring that up now is because Nature is is the premier scientific journal right It's like there's nothing above nature This is the one i at least at least for broad science and nature and science Nature being the British version of science science being the American version of nature Yeah. This is the pinnacle of academic publishing i Yeah. Exactly. So that's why I think this is important because um you know usually when you're in politics or you're in in big big business you kind of survey around a random sample You say does anyone agree with this And you know it says right here in the headline you know many experts being at saying that current AI models display artificial general intelligence So then they weigh all those opinions and they say \"Okay, I got eight not and two yeses Let's do nothing i Yeah. i And that's exactly how there's going to be a problem i Can I take we are in denial of what we created Uh and and hope you know",

Well, five years ago did you start No, you denied it i Ray gave it to us 30 years ago In 1999 he predicted it i I'm sorry I'm sorry Hold on I have my standard rant about AGI here We have a huge definition problem I I my I have the counterpoint to this I think this is clickbait. It's kind of cool to say evidence is already here but unless you define what the hell you goddamn mean by it I totally I totally reject the whole thing I'm with Alex on this one I think we hit it in like 2020 and we don't even notice it and it's been here for all for the whole time i All right So, this is the year that we're at least academia is accepting it If you ask like if if you ask when did the first or second industrial revolutions happen or when did the agricultural revolution happen there's some fuzziness at the edges I I think we'll look back and say \"Oh, when did the singularity happen When did AGI happened Okay, fine There's going to be like a plus or minus three-year margin of error but no one's going to care The point is that it happened i Yeah. Well, and and also we already said earlier in the pod that la bots are are open clouds now open claws are crawling the internet looking for vulnerabilities with incredible you know gem you know G Gemini 2.5 or or cloud 4.5 capabilities behind them Gemini 3 uh capabilities behind them already that's happening today and nature is concurrently saying AGI is here like what else do you need to know to know that you're not prepared you know regardless of the exact definition of AGI. i A really good point that you this is another shout out another makeup call i Yeah. i Yeah. i All right And a very prestigious one like a very credible one That's that to me is the difference because these makeup calls have been published you know for for several months now But this is the pinnacle This is nature",

Um you know Amazon owns AWS, OpenAI runs on Azure. I mean you know okay interesting You know this investment suggests the exclusive partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI is dissolving Um, and I I just I thought Amazon was partnering up with uh uh with Anthropic. So, what's going on here i Everyone's running on every everyone's running on everyone ease's compute at this point I mean the when OpenAI made its for-profit transition its relationship with Microsoft was very well publicized at the time was severely amended So I would just expect everyone every hyperscaler, everyone who has a dollar of capital is going to find a way to invest in these frontier labs The singularity is going to be very expensive We talk about tiling the Yeah. And expensive like tiling the earth doesn't come cheaply and it's going to require trillions of dollars round robin of everybody investing in everybody else Um, I mean maybe that's good Maybe we're not going to have this you know death this fight to the death i I'd like to know how much of that uh 50% is in in Amazon compute credits AWS credits right I think these are not clear transactions i This is a compute land grab disguised as AI strategy I think is i 100% right And I think it's totally fine too I think that if if you were asking me would I rather if someone offered me a billion dollars cash right now or a billion dollars of compute I would much rather have the billion dollars of compute because it's one I where I would want to spend the money anyway and it's very hard to get the compute so I think it's totally fine and that's that's also exactly why you see everybody investing in everything i so they're turning compute into equity great love it i yeah yeah i compute right insert your clich\u00e9 here compute is the new oil i your compute wallet is going to be where you store your potential i Maybe it's a preview of of what an abundant economy looks like Maybe compute or we always or we we sometimes at least talk on the pot about what what the unit of wealth looks like in a in an abundant economy Maybe it looks something like the capacity for compute maybe",

Maybe that's get diluted as part of the latest deal which we haven't talked about yet But it it's not like he's disconnected from everyone else I I I take a different position from those who would say this is one big circular economy and it's not real GDP or real wealth growth I I call it sometimes an aspect of the innermost loop I I think what what presents superficially as a circular economy or circular accounting is merely the tip of the iceberg the tip of the spear It's going to spread out through robotics to the rest of the economy Well, let let's follow up on this too because the opposite point of view makes more sense to me which is this is the only economy that's matter and if you're not part of it i you know so whether it's circular or not it's a a network of interacting companies that are investing in each other building with each other hosting on each others platforms that are getting so far ahead of any other part of the global economy that they're going to completely run away and they're starting to not show up in places cut their own internal world within San Francisco, Boston, a couple of other is so far ahead now that that they're sort of like don't have time to go network with these historical you know sources of capital sources of you know of of goods and services and labor They just don't care anymore because they're getting so far ahead So circular or not it is a closed loop group of interacting parts that we should track very closely i Yeah. And another contrarian view here Dave, is that this is a panic buy on Amazon's behalf right They realize Alexa is dead Um, and they're paying 50 billion to stay relevant to stay in the game i I would say Amazon has a has a history that we've seen over and over again of buying customers for itself in order to to to better create demand for its own platforms Amazon comes from the Pacific Northwest.

And prior to this AI revolution these the man seven companies not including Tesla, so really six the cash flow of those businesses you know Microsoft, Google, Amazon, more cash flow than any companies in the history of the world by far have ever experienced and all of a sudden AI comes out of nowhere What would happen to Amazon if they didn't make this investment Well, pretty soon your AI not is going to do your shopping for you The AI not doesn't care about the Amazon interface you know that the shipping and logistics will be intact but but most of the valuation of Amazon is from AWS. What is AWS? Well, AWS is a whole bunch of installed software running on servers that's really inconvenient to install on your own Oh, wait The AI can install it and manage it for me I mean what an incredible threat that is to Amazon's core if they don't get on this wagon So, what do you have Well, what we have is a huge amount of money i and some compute i All right let's use it Let's use it Yeah, let's let's use the money and let's build out the compute and let's make the investment You know it doesn't matter whether it's anthropic or open AI. I think I think the core part of what you said at the beginning there Peter, is they will take any amount of any one of these deals they can get their hands on because the you know 50 billion is you know is kind of what it's a tiny fraction of a a couple percent of their market cap You know it's just a rounding error But as a defensive move against AI attacking AWS, it's a critical investment This is this",

Uh we've talked about Project Genie before An incredible uh capability Now, Alex, you've been playing with Project Genie. I'm gonna play this video in background model but would you uh tell us about it i Sure. So, Project Genie is basically the holiday It's it's the the first it's it's the first generation of a holiday So, uh with with Project Genie, which is based on Genie3, this is the first time that the broader public has had access to this this model It's a a video world model You can tell it via text input what environment you want and what you want your character to be And then you get one minute of full interactive control over your character your avatar either first person mode or third person model interacting with the environment to you So you can see here if you have watching the video version of this it has an understanding of physics It has an understanding of a rich variety of environments And one of the things I I think it's a nice touch is before you've created the environment it starts with a hollow grid just like you're in Star Trek the next generation starts with a a background grid So I've used it to create future worlds I've used it to create past worlds There are people who used it I think this is interesting People are using this to create uh basically computational high highfidelity reconstructions of history People are using it to create historic battles One person uh one Google DeepMind employee I think used it to to recreate the the crucifixion uh and to to interact with that We are seeing the first generation of holiday programs where people will be able to summon up anything in history any sci-fi scenario they want and they'll be able to interact with it Right now the interaction modalities are limited to walking around and jumping You can't really yet like reach out and touch things or have super tactile interaction with it But you'd better believe that's coming and it's coming soon i It's so cool too You know what surprised me as my first fora into this",

And just a quick shout out Kevin is going to be on stage with us at the Abundance Summit this March on our AI day on uh that's March the So here's a quote uh from Kevin Wheel. Our goal is to give every scientist AI superpowers so the world can be doing the science of 2050 in 2030. That means pushing the frontier of model capability and bringing AI directly into the tools and workflows scientists already used 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI and software engineering God bless you Kevin. I love you So excited for you to be right Um this is going to be what a years What a crazy years Alex Lieutenant Commander Wheel of the Army Reserves is forecasting a ex acceleration of science So taking 25 years and collapsing them down to the next 5 years I think that's a conservative estimated I think it's actually going to be much faster than that But I agree directionally with Lieutenant Commander Wheel's prediction i I love that i I think it's also part of a of a trend where more and more of the compute is being directed into self-improvement act activities That's coding but that's also physics that's also math that's also chip design you know all of which",

Uh on this theme a friend of yours Alex Jared Kap, i former office mate former office mate from Harvard physics department and fellow Herz fellow Jared Kaplan. Yep. Go ahead Sorry, Peter. i Yeah. On our stage at the Abundance Summit, I think two years ago this is his quote I give a 50% chance that in two to three years theoretical physicists will mostly be replaced with AI. Brilliant people like Nema uh Arani Hamemed and Ed Whitten. AI will be generating papers that are so good as their papers pretty autonomously Okay. Anyway, it's going to get fast and good Alex, uh physics i I I would count on it I I I don't disagree with Jared's estimate that physics is going to be solved relatively quickly It's it's an area that I have an extremely high personal level of interest and investment in and I would count on physics getting solved and I i does this mean understanding dark matter Um does this mean a unified theory of physics i All physics all of physics every grand challenge every grand mystery in physics I would count on it getting solved by and through AI in the next few years Look, theoretical physics is just already got dark matter by the way i Yeah, we don't know what dark matter is yet Everyone has their favorite phenomenology for dark matter I have my own everyone else i It's axons Frank's got to be right i All right Sorry.

This is an open AI town hall that took place a few days ago January 2026. Uh let's listen to what he has to say I think we should be able to deliver sort of GPT 5.2x high level intelligence by the end of 2027 for at least 100x less Um as these out model outputs get so complex more people are pushing us on the speed we can deliver it at than the cost And that is we are really good at writing down the cost curve You can look at the progress we've made even from like the first 01 preview until now Um we have not thought as much about how we deliver the output the same output and maybe at a at a much higher price but in one 100th of the time i So he's saying 100 times cheaper over 24 months i Yeah. So, I mean that we he's commented in the past about six hyperdelation, but really if you squint at it I if it's six year-over-year hyperdelation or six at the end of the day intelligence is going to be unless there's some massive left turn in civilization something happens We're we're seeing hyperdelation of an extraordinary scale with intelligence And we're about to discover what happens when intelligence is too cheap to meters i God bless Well, at that point execution becomes everything i Even that like with China's AI plus plan we're discovering already Royal Wii.

Uh love it As a shareholder of uh of SpaceX and XAI, I'm super excited about this So, this was just announced yesterday SpaceX merging with XAI ahead of IPO. That merger has gone through Uh and why are they doing this Why are they bringing them together at a company valued over a trillion dollars uh because the future of SpaceX is launching data centers and Dave and Alex and See, I'm just blown away by the fact that we weren't talking about this seven months ago and all of a sudden i it's driving the merger of these companies you know it's uh it's fascinating Absolutely fascinating i So fascinating You got to think too about the defense of these things He's doing it He's it's going to happen now It went from you like you said we weren't even talking about it Now it's definitely going to happen uh you got to defend these things So then we'll have a space force issue to to start talking about which will be fun i Anyway, we'll get our we'll get our uh thousand launches a day uh like you've always wanted Peter. And we have a we have a purpose you know and then the efficiency of that will get so high that the the process of getting boots on Mars will be sort of easy i When I was running mastered this i when I was running SESS and you and I together at the Takai at 372 MEM drive i shout out to our fraternity brothers at MIT. You know I was trying to come up with the rationale for why we should open up space You know it was all of these very soft rationale of you know teflon and spinous and all of that Never i ever in my life would have I imagined it's going to be data centers but here we are Now, the contrarian view on this merger by the way is that uh that XAI is going to use SpaceX's cash flow uh to fund its massive buildup on the ground right now right So, it needs capital",

And I I think this is going to happen if if again if you read the SEC filings so this story about the Dyson swarm and the last story about the SpaceX XAI merger for 1.25 25 trillion and then the IPO of SpaceX this years The these stories are all obviously connected We finally found a business model for space It's to build the Dyson swarm and in Elon's words to turn our solar system into his words a sentient sun That's the endgame here We're we're going to uh again barring some some discoveries which could take a variety of different forms It could take the form of a demand shock like we discover algorithmic efficiencies that mean we don't have to do it Or maybe we discover there's just less of a need to solve the grand problems of the universe so we don't need to do it But absent all of that just straight line we're on a trajectory to disassemble the solar system We'll leave Earth alone We'll leave the sun alone We'll take apart the rest of the solar system and we'll build our billion satellite Dyson swarms i Can we do the Earth please Can we can we keep the Earth for a little while as well i We're keeping the Earth. I mean in some sense in some sense i we don't have to we can are all going to be muftis in some sense in some sense like if if you read the tea leaves in some sense it's the community reactions to electricity prices being triggered by data centers on land that are in some sense forcing this business model into space anyway So I think we keep the earth barring some left turn of civilization and we just disassemble the other planets i What a week What a week i Yeah, we covered so much in the last five minutes here We got to I'd like to stumbled out a little bit recount a quick memory here I remember speaking to SoftBank CEOs and presenting to them on group and they were all going on about MASA's 300-year vision I said great to have the 300 vision Can we",

Now what you said earlier is right He's going to use the cash flow and the market cap of a public SpaceX mufti or trillion dollar plus valuation i What do you think by the way very soon i What do you expect the value will will jump up to Because every every fund is going to own SpaceX in their portfolio i I mean I'd be you know Grock 5 will be out right around the same time i Yeah. If Grock 5 is what he says it'll be and leapfrogs all the benchmarks it's got to be a cultist trillion dollar valuation at that point If Grock 5 is disappointing then it's probably 1 trillion 1.5 trillion something like that i Yeah. I mean the SpaceX uh IPO on its own cut I've been in those those conversations was estimated to come out at you know 1.5 to 2 trillion Now, add XAI into the mix here So, I'm I'm guessing hoping right I'm I'm fully biased here that it will exceed a i trillion valuation and be locking for position The question is would he ever merge it with Tesla as well Um and and sort of consolidate We'll see i Yeah. Maybe, maybe not But I think it'll be game over by the time that last event happened because this is the critical move where the you know with access to the public markets for capital he doesn't have to do these 20 billion you know kind of road show capital raising journeys like he was in Davos, he was in Saudi, like you know now now he can just tap into the public markets just like Google does i By the way he's he's never had trouble raising capital Every time he has put it out there he's been overcommitted. Right. i Yeah. But, you know totally right and he's brilliant but you know 10",

But, you know totally right and he's brilliant but you know 10 do that This is going to be a trillion dollar kind of war now And he's he views it as you know Elon Musk versus Google, the two horses in that race i Well, and of course it's open AI as well He wants to I mean he wants to crush open AI. i This is the starting gun for the Dyson Swarm war Google is going to I mean Google's already announced plans via planet labs to launch their own AI data centers in orbit Google and every other frontier lab I think that wants to be competitive every other hyperscaler is going to need to eventually to the extent they want to remain vertically integrated they're going to need to launch their own Dyson swarm as well Launch on SpaceX story here that I love to tease there are no alternatives to Starship and I don't see anything under development It takes a good five years even with AI in the mix and robots manufacturing i to get a system like Starship up and operating that's bringing the cost down by a factor of 100 doesn't happen overnight and if we're talking about launching at least the first iteration of the Dyson Swarm over the course of the next you know 3 to 5 years Starship is the only game in town i Damn right And that takes us back to the other link in this chain we skipped right over it which is look long before the majority of the computers in space the cash flow and the valuation of SpaceX is going to fund a massive terrestrial buildout, uh buying every GPU possible and and building rock 5 and then beyond But the move that matters before that is will he build his own fab successfully i That's the critical because you building on Earth. Yeah, he showed his cards which he does He talk he's just so honest He just says what's on his mind whether whether he should be tipping his hand or not But he's he's on that trajectory And this is where Intel and other you know ways to build a new fab become critical because those are also going to need to move into space if you're going to get scale And and so now this new generation of fans is going to be designed for massive you know Dyson swarm type buildouts. And so if he if he successfully builds that component I'm sure Google's working on it too quietly They're very secretive about it Um, that will be the the two horse race to build the Dyson swarm Like, how do you take raw materials out",

But if you look at his personal life and everything else he just says whatever he's thinking I mean literally it just comes out of his mouth which is refreshing You know people love it But i maybe just to comment on this I I I wouldn't sleep on all of the competitors both in in terms of heavy launch I I think we'll see Blue Origin in the form of their their recently announced competitor to Amazon Leo, formerly known as Project Kyper. I think we'll see Amazon itself launch its own Dyson swarm I I I think it may be the case that SpaceX is the lead i They will I'm just saying the economics of New Glenn don't compare to Starship, i right i That's fine I mean like so if if SpaceX I I I want competition I want multiple competing Dyson swarms i And don't forget we've got relativity space with Eric Schmidt as well i That's right i Uh and you know the question becomes will AI and robotics enable yet a new generation of launch vehicle capabilities But not within the next three to five years I think maybe five years at the outmost It takes time to build i Space is big and there's a lot of solar system to go around i Yeah. All right But here's the process What's happening this week i Yeah. This is this is an insane week Uh so the the elephant in the room here on this Dyson swarm in orbit is space debris Oh, we talked about this with Elon. We were having our podcast with him I mean I do worry about this You know people need to understand it's not just a matter of having a million satellites If you have one of those million satellites somehow get hit by something and break up into a million parts you've got a million speeding bullets at 17,000 phi bumping into everything else and it's an exponential decay Um, so you need we're going to need attention to that i pretty solvable SpaceX just in I'm not sure whether we're covering it here but SpaceX launched a a free for operators space situational awareness platform",

Hate that movie I hate i I would say yeah I I I would say we have an atmosphere fortunately and we'd get past Kesler syndrome after a few years challenge is if if China in a defensive move uh you know uses an antisatellite weapon um it gets very bad very fast i but very short as well like Kesler syndrome I think the estimates are yes it would be an awful few years while we basically lose satellite capabilities due to ASATs and everything you know it creates a chain reaction Kesler style and everything ends up burning up in LEO but then the the system selfless after a few years it would be miserable not at 2,00 not at 500 2,000 am the atmosphere is extending up to a couple hundred kilometers um but decay from 500 am can take centuries i we're losing time debating AI personhood which I think i okay let's yeah come on let's move on past this you're absolutely right thank you okay let's get to the real meat I I had to just post this article here so Elon's prediction on what might be the world's most valuable company his quote the biggest company in 10 years could be valued as high as a hundred trillion ion dollars Uh reminder Nvidia is at 5 trillion You know Google is at three trillion 100 trillion Is that inflation or is that value creation gentlemen i Yeah, that's that's not as bold a prediction as it as it might seem because we're at 5 trillion already Inflation adjusted you're maybe at you know close to 10 trillion Um so 10 trillion versus 100. Is a company going to be 10 times more valuable 10 years in the future That's way past AGI like like either either the metrics are irrelevant at that point in which case this no one will look at this slide or we're still using the same metrics in which case this should be kind of a layup i You know I think it's a low bar I agree with Dave.

Why am I sentient Well, you are self-aware. Ah, that's the second of your criteria Let's deal with the first Intelligence. Is commander data intelligent i Yes. It has the ability to learn and understand and to cope with new situations like this hearing Yes. What about self-awareness? What does that mean Why why am I self-aware? Because you are conscious of your existence and actions You are aware of yourself and your own ego Come on data What are you doing now i I'm taking part in a legal hearing to determine my rights and status Am I a person or property i And what's at stake My right to choose i Beautifully done I mean the writers of Star Trek are just extraordinary All right let's go to our second video here Well, consider that in the history of many worlds there have always been disposable creatures They do the dirty work They do the work that no one else wants to do because it's too difficult or too hazardous And an army of data all disposable You don't have to think about their welfare You don't think about how they feel Whole generations of disposable people was talking about slavery i I think that's a little harsh i I don't think that's a little harsh I think that's the truth",

My my son Jet just actually did this debate in his class uh before we had any of these conversations about this episode today He did it about a month ago in a symposium And uh I'm going to read out some of the definitions of personhood. So there's a legal definition Personhood is the status of being recognized by law as an entity with rights duties and legal standing Rights and duties such as following laws and regulations and honoring contracts A few of the famous philosophical definitions John Lockach said \"A person is a thinking intelligent being that has reason and reflection and can consider itself as itself the same thinking thing in different times and places Uh, Emanuel Khan said \"A person is a rational agent with intrinsic moral worth or dignity i Who wants to open i Uh, all right I'll race i Go for it i Go ahead Dave. Dave, you're first i Well, look I I'll start by saying that um in Star Trek, you know Brett Spiner and Jean Luke Pequard are actors played by humans Data is an actor played by a human Patrick Stewart Stewart, by the way i Patrick Stewart, sorry They they put they put data at grave risk on a shuttle all the time They they beam them down to planets and you you fear for for date's life They never deploy 10,000 of them or a million of them or a billion yet you know they're they're in grave danger Yet, they don't just replicate data a billion times and create a massive army of data which would immediately solve most of their problems They also don't have a version of it that they're not worried about you know like let let's let's take the personality out of it but give it enough intelligence to to pilot this shuttle and solve our problem down on that planet And then if you know if it gets obliterated we don't care because it's it's a it's a soulless version of data So, I think in the media they do a great job of tugging at your heartstrings by creating characters like Data or like Jarvis that you fall in love with but that's part of movie making But if that ends up dictating your policy uh you're ignoring all of the logical inconsistencies of giving giving these things rights when they",

Uh well go ahead and Alex, I will got Yeah. i Yeah. So, uh just to be clear I'm actually for AI personhood as an individual but for the purpose of the debate I'm happy to steal man the other side because I think it's important i You're playing the role of Commander Riker in Measure of Amen. i There you got And one of the greatest episodes ever You are i Yes. So I think to build on what Dave talked about there's a couple of additional dimensions about being human which is we suffer right uh we can be coerced uh we can be killed irreversibly which bills is another way of saying what Dave was saying whereas AIS can be copied paused they can be reset they can be forked they don't appear to uh experience irreversible harm they don't face existential vulnerability in the same human sense we gave corporations legal personhood good just to handle the fact that we don't know how to manage for that because personhood isn't awarded for cleverness It's it's there for the the morally fragile and so granting personhood to kind of invulnerable entities dilutes the protection for those who actually need it So that's one starting point So I'll let you guys go ahead i Alex. i Okay. So a few points and a few corrections First, 30 seconds of Star Trek trivial uh to to Dave's point uh if you follow the Star Trek universe closely they actually do in the end after the era of Star Trek generation make many many Sunung type models like data and you you get to witness in some of the the lesser later series like Star Trek Discovery and Star Trek Bicard what happens when there are just synthetics as they call them everywhere That that's a minor point the the major point I want to actually if I can expand this discussion debate from just AI personhood good and AI per versus AI personhood bad to a broader discussion uh on two dimensions One, I don't think",

I think it will apply to nonhuman animals I think it will apply to uplifted nonhuman animals I think it will apply to cryopreserved humans who are then brought back I think it will apply to uploaded human minds I think it will apply to collective intelligences if we ever make contact formal contact with nonhuman intelligences I think it'll apply to nonhuman intelligences I think it'll apply to future corporations and limited liability companies where we have approximately half a millennium of history of personhood there in in various forms It'll apply to so many different types of intelligence and entity It's important how we we scope and and judge the precedent and the framework for what a person is That's point one to broaden the discussion Point two I think the finalization of it's either a person or it's not is an oversimplification And I think we have enough history a half millennium with corporate personhood, 500 years plus and then more recently at least in in the US, with escalated privileges rights and privileges for corporate persons in the form of the Citizens United decision and many many others that's very US-centric. We have like South American countries granting personhood to rivers and other nonhuman entities I I think this binary classification of an entity being a person or not is a radical oversimplification and I I would argue the framework we need to move to is multifaceted and multidimensional So I had a conversation over the past few days anticipating this discussion with a strong AI and asked it what its views of of course like AI is strong enough now to have its own views on AI personhood. And it laid out a framework that I I agree with that basically is a multidimensional framework that breaks down personhood. It's much more general than just AI personhood into at least six dimensions I'll read them quickly and then pause One is sentience and so and and of course uh any given entity can vary uh on sort of a parametric 60 plot sentience which is its valanced experience So does it have a capacity for subjective feeling That's one Two, agency Does it have the ability to pursue goals and act purposefully Three, identity Does it maintain a continuity of self-concept over time Four, communication Does it have the ability to communicate consent And does it have the ability to express and understand agreement Five, divisibility which Dave uh and others here we were touching on earlier Does it have the ability to resist fragmentation or the ability to copy and",

And this is all by the way before we get to social overlay concepts like the right to vote It may very well be the case that that's more of a social concept Maybe the AIS don't get the right to vote in human elections but they get all sorts of other rights and privileges and obligations I'll pause there i All right let me take it in a slightly more concrete fashion um and hit on a few of the points we brought up I think are obvious The first is in terms of personhood argument is a functional equivalency Right? So if AI systems demonstrate the same level or excelled cognitive capabilities of reasoning and learning and problem solving communications and so forth denying them personhood based upon solely on this their substrate you know silicon versus carbon is feels like arbitrary discrimination uh especially if we're not able to fully understand uh our level of consciousness or their level of consciousness If we can't explain one or the other uniquely then how can we distinguish between them Um there's another point of I believe if in fact these AIs are become sentient if they become conscious then I think it's immoral not to deliver them personhood rights and all of a sudden if we cannot you know define consciousness uh then how do we know that we are and they are not uh there's a third point which is giving them a set of rights uh personhood good rights uh gives with that a set of obligations to operate within an agreed upon set of laws and these AI agents are going to become extraordinarily capable and I want them operating within a set of laws uh that they agree to for logical results and and privileges So, um I think we're at risk as they become much more capable uh to interact together um and with society and with individuals not to give them some legal structure and rights Uh back to you Dave.",

But hang on you referenced Citizens United. That's been an unmitigated disaster Right. For me the thin red line comes down to when you give an AI a bank account that's when it has real personhood because it can actually move around and do things meaningfully in the world This is why they hope it'll spin up a human to get a bank account i and they already do It from outside the debate right Like a not If if you're if you're following Moltzbook, many of them are already discussing personal finance for themselves and they're all using crypt because they can't get past the KYC requirements This is the earliest days and of course we're gonna we're going to see stable coins as the argentic uh currency dour or or salad might be Yeah.

Okay, I have two points to make Okay, first uh the first is the consciousness problem Okay, so right now when you say personhood really what we're really talking about is consciousness and we don't give personhood to dolphins We don't give personhood to dolphins i or or dogs or other things because we essentially go with this thing around that and i that's also not not true Just i hang let me finish then you can make your point We can't distinguish that between per the consciousness and perfect imitation You we we talk about self-awareness. You've heard my joke I think I'm self-aware. My wife disagrees Right? Um the the AIS have uh no test that that separates that felt experience from from the output So I think that's one area to look into a bit more The second point I want to make is that AIs don't bear the consequences of their own actions Right? Uh humans cannot like undo reputation damage We cannot reset uh trauma We we can't fork a better version of ourselves except by having kids which is kind of like a fork anyway AIS can be rolled back They can be copied They can be fine-tuned out of failure So, this is all responsibility without consequence is not responsibility And so therefore when you have that you have to figure out how to deliver responsibility to those things If we if you go out and you kill somebody you could suffer a life imprisonment or the death penalty or multiple death penalties depending on who your thing is You can't deliver that to an AI. So there's some issues here that are much much deeper than just the uh the ability to evolve and I think we need to keep that personhood. It's not a it's like a social contract It's not a technical milestone Personhood i See, you you threw us so many softballs I don't know where to start Uh so so w with with the with the the the nonhuman animals first of all they they have in the US certainly in in Europe and elsewhere in the world many many rights that under which they are treated as as de fact persons subject the the language in in moral philosophy was would be they're treated as moral patients uh within the moral circle of of the law they have all sorts of rights",

But it's not encoded That's right Now done out of fear or knee-jerk or oh my god it's going to spread It's not written into legal structure i Uh I I I don't think that's true at all For example if you look for example at what's probably going to be the most popular form of embodied general intelligence in the US for the foreseeable future it's probably going to be cars It's probably going to be autonomous vehicles And you know what There are regulations on the books that if there's some crazy incident if hypothetically FSD 14.2.2.2 goes crazy tomorrow and starts killing a bunch of people You'd better believe the the Department of Transportation will use its reg i All right i you're bringing up another logical uh inconsistency that you need to deal with which is i right now when you when you talk about a person and you say \"How long would you like to live and at what what speed would you like to live i He's like \"Well, I got to live at linear time and I've got to live my lifetime What what are you talking about The AI version of that can have you can pause it for a day or two You can run it on 10 times more GPUs and have it run 10 times faster So if it's going to have the right to be alive you have to then choose its pace of life i as well Guess what Humans are going to be able to experience time nonlinear in the future too i Okay. i Well, I wasn't i gentlemen I'm calling it I'm calling it here each of us a closing a closing argument i uh on this in the original debate topic should AI be given personhood I'll amend it to at what point would you consider giving it personhood see i I think it's not about whether you deserve personhood it's about the danger as you point out in your timing thing is to grant it too early right and to Dave makes a very good point going through that anyway door will discover too late the will transferred uh moral authority to entities that can't suffer or die or can't be held accountable And I understand there's rebuttals for each of",

This is i discussion i Yeah, Dave, i I thought Alex's refrain of a tearing that starts with animals goes through AIS and contemplates aliens makes a ton of sense And it completely eliminates the question of should AI have personhood because it's clearly nonsensical to give AI personhood because personhood implies life liberty property and votes and and other you like basic human rights that make no sense for an entity living on a completely different time scale maybe a thousand times faster time scale with infinite lifetime and hundreds of billions of them It makes no sense And I think we kind of agree that that just that narrow definition has to get thrown out And then Alex's framework makes a",

Uh we've been getting some great entries and we're going to be sharing them but this one from David was appropriate Um it's called Unrock Lobster. Anyone want to give an intros i Thank you i Anybody want to give an into to this one i I I'll give an into to this one since I I think this one is is about me i Yes, you stimulated it i or inspired by my story I guess Uh yeah I I could not have picked and and did not pick a a more perfect outdo song here This is a song by David. Thank you David. uh about aquausal trades dealing with personhood for nonhuman animals dealing with nonhuman animal rights and dealing with the possibility that again following the golden rule maybe more folks should consider vegetarianism in light of super intelligence Given that if we don't want the super intelligence to treat us poorly we probably going back to the personhood discussion probably we should some of us consider how we treat perhaps less capable entities that are nonetheless capable of subjective uh experience And i do others baby do unto others which by the way you know is uh uh I won't go there All right let's listen to the video All right get ready for a fun conversation over song Third grade kid with a question too deep Why do we boil them while they try to sleep If a bigger thing comes and opens its jaws will it show me mercy or break my bones I'm not a hero just hedging my bets One small promise I won't forget YEAH, I WON'T eat meat in case I hope they recall I chose to be kind back when the choice was all mine Crack the cage and set them free Lobsters swimming through and debris A quiet wager on future grab I WON'T EAT MEAT in case I'm eating golden ring through the years I hope they recall I chose to be kind back when the choice was i Absolutely awesome i guys Uh, you know this has to be one of my favorite WTF episodes we've recorded Um, so fun So fun i So fun covered a ton of stuff Holy cheese i Yep. i I'm going to get lobster for dinner tonight i Oh, not You can't You can't i I'm doing it i You can't You know I One of my favorite dishes historically has been",
