        "text": " Weather has a profound impact on our daily lives. Predicting how it will affect agriculture, energy, aviation, and emergency response is critical. But the atmosphere is chaotic and forecasting is complex. NVIDIA Earth-2 changes the paradigm. It accelerates the AI revolution in forecasting by offering developers and researchers an open set of tools that lowers the barrier to AI-enabled weather simulation. Building on the impact of models like FourCastNet and CorrDiff, NVIDIA Earth-2 is now a complete portfolio of open models. Introducing Earth-2 Global Data Assimilation, Nowcasting, and Medium Range. To initialize predictions, Earth-2 Global Data Assimilation models turn observations from diverse sources like balloons, satellites, and stations into atmospheric states in seconds, a task that previously took hours on high-performance computing clusters. Earth-2 Nowcasting models offer severe weather prediction at continental scale from zero to six hours. They represent the first time AI has surpassed the accuracy of physics-based forecasting of storm evolution. Earth-2 Medium Range models deliver 15-day global forecasts with accuracy that outperforms other open models on standard benchmarks across more than 70 variables. Earth-2 models span the complete forecasting pipeline. When they\u2019re combined, weather can be simulated at speeds previously impossible, minutes instead of hours or days. And because Earth-2 is completely open, not just model weights but inference tools and training frameworks too, developers can customize and fine-tune simulations to specific needs, using their own data and infrastructure to build sovereign weather and climate predictions with full control. See into the future of weather with NVIDIA Earth-2.",
