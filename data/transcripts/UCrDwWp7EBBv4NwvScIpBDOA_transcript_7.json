        "text": " Can you help us calculate the price of the tamales for wholesale with a 60% margin? Absolutely. Let's break it down step by step. We want to be a formal business instead of a family business. But it's very, very difficult. Christian was a baby when I started selling tamales out of the trunk of my car. We kind of been learning along as we go. Selling tamales at the farmers markets is 50% of our business. It's a lot. A lot of farmers markets. A lot of work. I want to make it easier for our customers to find us. What Christian is doing, is definitely going to transform our company. I just asked ChatGPT, can you create a map that includes all my farmers markets? I've never coded a single line in my life. Just like that. It's great. Wow. That's awesome man. So can I get a raise? No. My grandma's tamales are the best tamales I've ever tried in my life. There's a lot of learning by doing everything here. I did not go to business school. Okay, it sounds like that particular error message is linked to an issue with the sensor. Sometimes you're like, I know how to say it in Spanish, but I don't know how to say it in English. Help me write a formal letter to the employees about changes in scheduling. Absolutely I can help with that. With ChatGPT I feel like I've been to a seminar and I can speak to anybody from the person who cleans, to the CEO of a company. That's how confident I feel now. I think we should put... I like this one here. ...the taller ones here. I think we're going to need another shelf. I think we are. Public speaking is one of the biggest fears for everybody. I want to sound friendly, warm but professional. First we have Xochitl. We\u2019re really excited. It's a tradition that has not only become part of our family, but also a part of the community that we serve. The Original Tamale Company started with my parents in the backyard. Working with family, there is no better reward in life, even though you might want to strangle some of them, sometimes. My dream is for this business to continue with the younger generations. We have to keep competing and competing and making sure that we stay on the top. Three chicken tamales? Yes please. Coming right up. The business is our baby. I hope that our legacy can continue on for years to come.",
