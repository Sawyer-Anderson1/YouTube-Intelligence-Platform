        "text": " CES 2026 officially opened its doors on January 6 in Las Vegas. And right away it was clear that something had shifted AI was still everywhere but not in the way it used to be Instead of being pitched as the product itself AI showed up as the engine behind almost everything on display Robots, energy systems autonomous vehicles wearable desk devices and home machines all depended on it The announcements weren't about new apes or cloud features anymore They were about physical systems designed to operate in the real world with AI running underneath handling perception decision-making, and music control You didn't have to wait long to see that robotics had taken over the showroom floor Multiple booths were running live demos from the moment the doors opened with humanoid robots moving continuously rather than cycling through short scripted routines Some were interacting with people others were running balance and motion tests and several were set up purely to show raw mechanical capability instead of finished products Unit's demo area focused on full body movement and control The robots were performing coordinated sequences that mixed walking turning and upper body motion without stopping between actions During the demos the robots adjusted their posture midmovement and recovered balance after small disturbances which showed mealtime perception and motion control running continuously instead of step-by-step command execution music Sharpa's setup centered on its robotic hand mounted on a full-bodied robot mainly for positioning The hand was shown performing fine manipulation tasks changing grip force finger placement and orientation while handling small objects Sharpa confirmed the hand is already being sold to universities for research used which means it's snorts stable enough for repeated daily operation The demo made it clear that precise physical manipulation is no longer experimental and is now usable outside controlled lab environments LG went on stage with Cloyd, its autonomous home robot and framed the whole thing around what it calls physical AI. Clody has a wheeled base for safety and stability a tilting torso and two arms with seven degrees of freedom each Finished with five fingered music hands designed for fine manipulation The head is basically a mobile AI hub with cameras sensors speakers a display and voice-based generative AI baked in LG showed it folding laundry and handling household objects slowly deliberately almost cautiously And that slowness was telling This wasn't a stunt This was LG signaling that it's training models on tens of thousands of hours of household data and prioritizing reliability over speed It already felt like a line being drawn between companies chasing applause and companies building systems meant to live in homes long terms Elsewhere on the floor Robo Rock showed something that caught almost everyone off guard The Sorrows Rover is a robot vacuum with legs Not metaphorically actual wheeled hinged limbs that let it climb stairs balance itself handle ramps and clean steps while it moves In a CES demon it took",

That price point matters This isn't a luxury experiment It's a signal that robotic companionship is heading toward mass market territory whether people music are fully comfortable with that or not That same tension showed up in the wave of AI companions designed to sit on desks Razer presented a physical version of Project Ava, its gaming copilot embodied as a cylindrical desktop device displaying an animated character called Kira. It watches gameplay, reacts in real time and gives tips Lepro Amy took a more intimate route showing an AI sulfate device with a small curved OLED screen designed to simulate emotional connection These weren't framed as jokes or novelties They were framed music as product categories The convergence of AI and hardware wasn't limited to robots Lenovo and Motorola used the show to make a big statement literally inside the Las Vegas sphere Lenovo showcased reliable laptop concepts that expand from standard aspect ratios into ultrawide displays The ThinkPad Roll XD even wraps its OLED screen around the lid to create a second outward-facing display These are still concepts but the engineering is clearly far along You can feel Lenovo testing where flexibility actually becomes useful rather than gimmicky Motorola used the same event to debut its bookstore Razer Fold, officially stepping beyond clamshell foldable The Razer Fold features a 6.6 in external display and an 8.1 in internal screen along with a 50 megapixel camera system Pricing and full specs are still coming later this years but the form factor alone puts Motorola directly into competition with Samsung and Google in a space that used to feel closed off Motorola also leaned hard into accessories showing the Moto Pen Ultra stylus with 4,96 levels of pressure sensitivity and the Moto Tag 2 tracker with double the battery life of its predecessor music The show also tied hardware directly to global events Lenovo and FIFA announced that AI powered three-dimensional digital avatars will be integrated into refereeing and broadcasts for the FIFA World Cup 2026.

Using generative AI and three-dimensional assets Lenovo is players including music accurate physical attributes like height These avatars will be used in offside replays and other officiating visuals giving fans clearer context both in stadiums and at home The announcement landed quietly compared to flashy gadgets but it's one of those moments that hints at how AI visualization is becoming infrastructure not entertainment music On the computing side chips did a lot of heavy lifting Intel officially launched its Core Ultraeries 3 processors renamed music Panther Lake, built on the new Intel 18A process These chips promise up to 27 music hours of battery life in laptops which is a number that would have sounded absurd not long ago Intel also unveiled the ARKB390 integrated GPU, claiming discrete class performance while maintaining that battery life target music Pre-orders for Panther Lake laptops opened immediately with shipping scheduled for January 27th. Intel also confirmed it's building an entire handheld gaming platform around Panther Lake, including a dedicated handheld exclusive processor called Core G3. music Specs are still under wraps but the intent is clear Intel wants a serious foothold in a space that AMD has dominated for years AMD, meanwhile used its time to reinforce how aggressively it's positioning itself around AI. CEO Lisa Sue predicted that AI usage will grow from 1 billion active users to 5 billion within 5 years AMD showed off Ryzen AI 400 music processors and like server chips framing them as foundational for everything from personal devices to data centers The market reaction was muted but the message was not Nvidia took an even sharper stance Jensen Huang's keynote made it explicit that Nvidia is no longer prioritizing consumer GPUs at events like CES. There were no new GeForce cards Instead, Nvidia talked about AI infrastructure robotics autonomous vehicles and massive data center platforms like Vera Rubin moving into full production Hang repeatedly used the phrase physical AI, reinforcing that Nvidia sees its future in powering machines that interact with the real world That focus on physical systems extended all the way into energy Commonwealth Fusion Systems announced it's working with Nvidia and Seammens to build a digital twin of its Spark fusion reactor Spark is a demonstration reactor currently under construction in Massachusetts, and the company has already installed its first 24 ton magnet Seaman's software is being used to design and operate systems that simply don't exist yet in commercial form The goal here isn't music short-term power generation It's proving that Fusion can be designed simulated and eventually scaled Fusion was presented as an engineering problem actively being solved Consumer teach still had its moment but even there AI was deeply embedded N'SH introduced its",

Shipping is expected 60 days after launch This felt less like a gadget and more like music a glimpse of how automation might creep into kitchens incrementally Blumen 8 showed a different kind of intelligence music with its e in canvas frames These ultra low power displays can show personal photos or AI generated art and run for 1 to 3 years on a battery because there's no backlight Frames come in sizes up to 28.5 music in with a new 10-in model launching under $200. It's subtle techs but it reflects how AI is quietly entering domestic spaces without demanding attention Kids teach also made a showing Nodi unveiled a handheld device designed for children who aren't ready for smartphones. It supports voice messages controlled Spotify streaming and parent approved contacts Pricing starts at $149 for Wi-Fi and $179 for LTE with battery life lasting several days The company has raised $1.3 million and plans to launch in the US this summer AI mediated communication for children is already being productized. Even beauty teach wasn't immune I polish demoed colorchanging press on nails using electrofaretic nanopolymers, a technology the company has spent over a decade developing Users can switch between more than 400 nail colors via an happy The starter kit costs $95 with replacement nail packs at $6.50. The company holds 23 patents on the technology and plans to ship starting in June. Gaming hardware had its own wave Lenovo announced a Steam OS version of the Legion Goto, addressing one of the biggest complaints about Windows-based handheld The Steam OS version launches at $1,199, slightly higher than the Windows model Nvidia introduced DLSS 4.5, which pushes multiframe generation up to six times generating five AI frames for every rendered frame AMD quietly refreshed its Ryzen 79800X3D with the 9850X3D, adding a 400 MHz clock bump It's a small upgrade but it keeps AMD's gaming dominance intact Displays went big as expected Samsung previewed its 130in microRGB TV, while LG announced its own MicroRGB EVO lineup in sizes up to 100 in MicroRGB technology uses self-emissive LEDs for red green and blue delivering higher brightness and color accuracy compared to miniLEDD.
