While Boston Dynamics showed the world what controlled agility looks like and Unit's G1 proved how fast lowcost humanoids are catching up. Engine AI has officially unleashed the T800 robot and they've built a literal humanoid robot combat league for it. Hey guys, Alfie here. Welcome back to the AI Nexus. On February 9th, Engine AI officially announced the world's first commercial humanoid free combat leak. Think of it like the UFC, but instead of flesh and bone, it's 165 lbs of aviation grade aluminum and high torque actuators colliding inside the ring. The scale of this is insane. We're talking about a tiered competition running through December of this year where 16 teams ranging from elite university labs to hardcore robotic startups are going head-to-head. And here is the kicker. Engine AI is providing the T800 robots to these teams free of charge. They want the smartest minds on the planet to take their hardware and program the most lethal robot kung fu algorithms possible. Why would a company give away millions of dollars in hardware just to watch it get beat up in an octagon? Because of the 1.44 million prize. The winning team gets a 10 kg solid gold championship belt valued at roughly 10 million remn. But the real goal isn't the gold. It's the data. Engine AI knows that if a robot can survive a roundhouse kick to the chassis and stay standing, it can survive anything a factory floor or a disaster zone can throw at it. These matches aren't just for show. They follow a best of three format. If a robot gets knocked down [music] and can't stand up within 10 seconds, that's a knockout. If the human operators have to step in and reset the bot twice, that's a technical knockout. We are seeing real-time strategy where humans guide the highle tactics. But the T800's onboard AI handles the balance, the striking, [music] and the survival instincts. Experts are terrified because this isn't just entertainment. It's a high-speed evolution of predatory movement in machines. Now, if you're thinking, \"Alfie, this has to be CGI, right?\" You aren't alone. Back when the first T800 promos dropped in late 2025, the internet exploded with claims that the footage was fake. The movements were too fluid, the spinning kicks too perfect. So, Engine AI CEO Xiao Tongyang did something legendary or maybe just crazy. He didn't release a statement. He stepped into the ring. In a video that is now dominating every tech platform, Xiao suited up in heavy protective gear and stood directly in front of his creation. The footage is haunting. You see the T800 stabilize its stance, calculate the distance, and fire off a high torque sidekick. The impact didn't just move him. It lifted the CEO off the ground and dropped him straight onto the mat. No V effects, no wires, just pure mechanical force. After the strike, the",

It lifted the CEO off the ground and dropped him straight onto the mat. No V effects, no wires, just pure mechanical force. After the strike, the gyroscopic sensors and real-time control loops reset its balance in milliseconds. Xiao's reaction after the test, too violent, too brutal. Without this gear, anyone would break a bone. He joked that he couldn't guarantee he'd stay alive for the next test. It was a terrifyingly effective way to shut down the doubters. This wasn't a publicity stunt. It was a stress demonstration. It proved that the T800 is built for unpredictability and massive impact, making it the perfect athlete for the URL Combat League. So, what makes the T800 capable of this level of violence? Let's look at the engineering because this is where the Terminator inspiration becomes reality. First, the name isn't just a marketing gimmick. Engine AI borrowed the philosophy of the movie T800, a machine with a strong structure and proportions that mimic an adult human perfectly. This thing is a beast. Torque and power. Each joint motor delivers up to 450 new m of torque. To put that in perspective, that's enough force to generate bone shattering striking momentum. We're talking about an instantaneous [music] peak power output of 14,000 watts. Active cooling. Pushing that much force creates a massive amount of heat. Most robots would melt their own circuits or have to take a break. The T800 features a world first active cooling system built directly into its leg joints. This prevents thermal throttling, allowing the robot to fight or work for up to 4 hours without stopping. Energy system. It's powered by a solidstate lithium battery architecture. This is safer and more energy dense than standard batteries. Designed specifically for highintensity sessions where a performance drop isn't an option. The brain, it's running on the Nvidia Jetson Thor chip, delivering a staggering 2,000 tops of AI compute power. This allows for millisecond level environmental processing through its 360\u00b0 LAR and stereo depth cameras. It's not just moving, it's perceiving the fight. Engine AI even ditched the robot shuffle. Most humanoids walk with bent knees [music] to stay stable. The T800 aims for straight leg walking, making its gate look eerie and natural. Every microcorrection in its hips and ankles is calculated in real time, allowing for those Capo air inspired spinning transitions that looked too real to be true. The T800 represents a shift in how we build AI. By moving out of the lab and into the combat arena, Engine AI is accelerating the development cycle of these machines by over 30%. They are planting seeds for a future where robots can handle any physical environment, no matter how chaotic. But it leaves us with a chilling question. If we are training robots to be the ultimate",

They are planting seeds for a future where robots can handle any physical environment, no matter how chaotic. But it leaves us with a chilling question. If we are training robots to be the ultimate their roles in our world tomorrow? Is the T800 a breakthrough in engineering? or are we literally building the foundation for the sci-fi nightmares we've watched on screen for decades? What do you think? Would you step into the ring with AT800, even with the best armor on the planet? And do you think this combat first approach will actually help them build better service robots? Let me know in the comments below. I'll be hanging out there to discuss. All right, the T800 entering the world's first robot combat league is already insane. But that's not the only humanoid pushing limits right now. While Engine AI is putting robots inside a fighting ring, Unit's G1 is out in the real world and it just learned how to skateboard. Unree G1 just learned to skateboard [music] in the real world. Boston Dynamics new Atlas just went full human mode, moving like a trained gymnast. Droid up unveiled a hyperrealistic humanoid named Moya that looks, moves, and even feels human. Spang's iron collapsed mid demo in front of a live crowd. Hey guys, Alfie here. Welcome back to the AI Nexus. This week, the line between machine and human shifted again. A humanoid robot just learned to skateboard, not as a staged lab trick, but as a real skill executed in the open world, on solid ground, on asphalt, moving freely without human support. The G1 humanoid from Unitri Robotics pulled it off. And what makes it remarkable isn't [music] just balance. It's the intelligence behind every movement. This breakthrough came from a collaboration between China Telecom's Teleai Institute, Shanghai Xiaoong University, and several leading Chinese research teams. At the center of the project is a new control framework known as Husky, a physicsaware whole body system built specifically for dynamic tasks like skateboarding. Instead of teaching the robot to replay [music] fixed motions, Husky allows the G1 to reason about how its entire body interacts with the skateboard in real time. Every lean, weight shift, [music] and posture adjustment is mathematically tied to how the board responds underneath. When the [music] robot tilts, it understands how sharply the board will turn and how much force is needed to remain stable. The physics aren't approximated. They're embedded directly into the control logic. Before ever stepping onto a real skateboard, the G1 trained entirely inside a physics simulation. Thousands of parallel training environments ran simultaneously, compressing millions of motion trials into [music] roughly 20 hours of compute time. Once the system stabilized, those learned behaviors were transferred directly into the physical robot using a SIM to real pipeline. The result is striking. The G1 can push off",

Once the system stabilized, those learned behaviors were transferred directly into the physical robot using a SIM to real pipeline. The result is striking. The G1 can push off steer by shifting weight, and smoothly mount or dismount the board across indoor floors, outdoor pavement, and uneven walkways. Even when nudged midride, it recovers and stays upright. This is the first humanoid robot to achieve realworld skateboarding through reinforcement learning. We just watched a robot learn to skate. [music] What happens when it learns everything else? And while Unit focused on balance and learning, Boston Dynamics focused on power and performance, Boston Dynamics just dropped footage that completely changes the conversation around humanoid robots. Atlas executed [music] a flawless backflip and landed precisely on its toes with the kind of control you'd expect from an Olympic gymnast, not a 110 lb [music] robot. Here's what makes this absolutely mindblowing. Rewind just 1 month to early January 2026 and you'll find a very different story. The same Atlas robot appeared unstable and leaked footage with visible damage to its palm mechanism. Most observers thought the technology was still years away from realworld readiness. Boston Dynamics proved everyone wrong in record time. The big reveal happened at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, where Boston Dynamics showcased the production ready electric version of Atlas. This electric model reaches 7.5 ft in height and handles loads up to 110 lb with remarkable precision. Engineers built it to withstand brutal factory conditions, operating smoothly in temperatures ranging from -4\u00b0 F all the way up to 104\u00b0. The real game changer announced at CES was the partnership with Google DeepMind. Boston Dynamics integrated Gemini artificial intelligence directly into Atlas, giving the robot genuine problem solving capabilities. Instead of requiring detailed programming for every task, Atlas can now observe its environment and execute complex sequences independently. This cognitive upgrade means Atlas can master entirely new factory tasks in under [music] 24 hours. Hyundai Motors revealed their aggressive manufacturing timeline at the same event. The company is constructing a facility designed to build 30,000 [music] Atlas units annually with deployment into American factories beginning within the next 2 years. These robots will run continuous 24-hour operations, handling everything from heavy component transport to precision assembly work. Atlas even swaps its own battery packs at charging stations without human intervention. The transformation from shaky prototype to backflipping factory worker happened faster than anyone predicted. While Atlas mastered [music] strength and agility, another company focused on realism. Did China just build the most realistic [music] robot on the planet? That question is suddenly very real because a Shanghai based startup called Droid Up has unveiled a humanoid robot named Moya. And the realism is mind-blowing. Moya stands about 5'5 and weighs just 32 kg, which is shockingly light for a full humanoid robot. That low weight matters",

Moya stands about 5'5 and weighs just 32 kg, which is shockingly light for a full humanoid robot. That low weight matters better balance, and safer interaction around people. The first thing everyone notices is the skin. Moya is covered in high-end silicone synthetic skin designed to copy human texture and even human warmth. When you touch [music] the robot, it does not feel cold or metallic. It feels warm and that instantly changes how your brain reacts. But here's the crazy part. The face is not just animated. Moya's head has 25\u00b0 of freedom. That means micro expressions, [music] small eyebrow shifts, subtle eye movement, tiny lip changes, the same nonverbal cues people use every day without thinking. This is where the uncanny valley hits hard. Under that lifelike exterior is serious engineering. Moya runs on an upgraded walker skeleton evolved from a humanoid robot that placed third in the world's first humanoid half marathon in Beijing. 13 mi. No shortcuts. [music] Real endurance. The new Walker platform improves cooling and long-term movement using lightweight lattice muscle materials, making the robot move naturally for longer periods. And this robot is not built for factories. Droid up is aiming directly at elder care, companionship, and everyday human environments. Moya is modular, too. Hair, skin tone, and appearance can be customized without changing the core robot. So, here's the real question. If a robot looks human, feels warm, and reacts emotionally, does [music] that make interaction easier, or deeply uncomfortable? Because robots like Moya are no longer experimental, they are preparing to live around us, which brings us to a very public test in Shenzhen. Xping's iron humanoid robot just faceplanted at a shopping mall in Shenzhen. The robot was walking through the crowd when it suddenly lost balance and fell hard. Cameras caught everything and the video spread fast online, but CEO Haang didn't hide from it. He posted on social media calling it part of the learning process, explaining that realworld testing means dealing with falls and failures. But here's the crazy part. When Iron first appeared in public, people didn't believe it was actually a robot. The movement looked too smooth, too natural. Online comments exploded with accusations that Xping was faking it by putting a human inside a robot suit. [music] So what did Xiaoing do? He literally peeled back the robot skin during a live demonstration and showed everyone the internal structure. motors, wiring, actuators, everything mechanical underneath. So why does Xping make Iron look this human? The company wants robots that can use human tools, fit through human doorways, and work in spaces [music] designed for us. To pull that off, Iron uses lightweight lattice muscle materials that mimic how real muscles contract and expand, giving it smoother and more efficient movement",

[music] The company just launched a quadriped robot designed like a pony. This puts Xping in direct competition with Uni Tree and Boston Dynamics in the four-legged robot space. But Xping's version has something wild. A flexible robotic arm that works like a tail. It can tuck between the legs or [music] extend out to grab objects, open doors, and handle tasks that typical quadripeds can't touch. Xping is pushing hard to make robots that actually work in the real world falls in all. And honestly, that messy honest approach might be exactly what gets us to a future where robots are everywhere. But while some companies test robots in malls, others introduce them to the entire world. Here's the moment that quietly changed the tone of robotics this week. During the Super Bowl, an event watched by over a 100 million people, Open AI slipped something unexpected into its commercial. Not a humanoid robot on stage. Not a sci-fi character, just hands, human hands. And then robotic hands moving together. The ad showed people building, creating, and guiding tools, [music] ending with a pair of robotic arms being directed by human motion. No explosions, no hype characters, just a clear message. You can just build things. But here's the crazy part. That single visual choice signaled something much bigger than an ad for software. Open AI has spent years telling the world it focuses on intelligence, not hardware. [music] Yet placing a bimanual robot in the most valuable advertising slot on Earth was not accidental. The robotic hands were shown as extensions of human intent, not replacements. That framing matters. It positions robots as tools that act through language, instructions, and reasoning, not remote controls or scripts. The ad centered on codecs, Open AI's coding agent, but the subtext was physical. Software no longer stops at screens. It flows into arms, joints, and real world actions. This lines up with OpenAI's recent work on bmanual manipulation where robots respond to natural language and perform coordinated tasks like sorting objects or handling dishes. Even though Open AI no longer partners with figure AI, the direction is clear. And remember where this aired. The Super Bowl is to America what the World Cup or cricket finals are elsewhere. Showing robotic hands here wasn't about developers. It was about normalization, about telling the public that robots are becoming part of everyday creation. The staggering part is what was missing. No uncanny faces, no talking robots, just hands doing work. That restraint suggests confidence. Open AI didn't need to announce a robot. The signal was enough. When robotic hands show up on the biggest stage in the world, the future",
