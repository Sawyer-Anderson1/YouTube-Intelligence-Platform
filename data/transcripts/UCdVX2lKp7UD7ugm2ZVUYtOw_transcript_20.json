        "text": " Twilight drips from cedar spines, Moth-wing clocks keep gentle time. Dew writes numbers on the leaves, Soft equations in the trees. Lantern fog between the pines, Footsteps learning stepwise lines\u2014 I slow my breath; the forest hums, Every shadow speaking sums. I trace the shimmer through the dark, Questions gather, find a spark; In the hush, the patterns start\u2014 A quiet algorithm of the heart. Forest phosphor, glow logic, Teach my steps to read the night. Every flicker, coded music, Every ember points me right. Bioluminescent learning, Threaded paths beneath my feet\u2014 I become the light I\u2019m earning, As the midnight makes me see. As the midnight makes me see. Roots exchange their little sparks, Wood-wide signals, hidden arcs. Fireflies like data points Pin the map at secret joints. Owl-soft clicks, a metronome, Mycelial wires under loam\u2014 When I stumble, lights rearrange; Loss grows smaller, truths remain. I breathe the waveform in the air, Neon pollen everywhere; What I notice, what I keep\u2014 Teaches while the cedars sleep. Let the path learn me as I learn it, Let the river carry code; Hands outstretched, I move by pixels, Stars like cursors on the road. Forest phosphor, glow logic, Guide me softly, page by page\u2014 As I walk, the meaning gathers, Lines of light across the glade. Glowing margins, page of night\u2014 Forest writes me back in light.",
