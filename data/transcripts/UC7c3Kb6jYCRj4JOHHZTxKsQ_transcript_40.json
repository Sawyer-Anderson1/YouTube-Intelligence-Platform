        "text": " Microsoft just signed a deal that is bigger than the GDP of some countries and it's all about GPUs. They just signed this deal with the sponsor of this video, Nebius. Nebus is a relatively new player in the AI infrastructure space, but they locked in a $17.4 billion 5year deal with Microsoft to power their biggest AI projects. Now, you know, Microsoft is now creating their own models. They need a ton of pre-training inference. They need a ton of post-training. So this is all going to be powered by not only Azure but also Nebus. And here's the thing, you can get access to Nebus yourself. And so if you're building with open source models, if you want to get inference from open source models, Nebus AI studio is the place to go. If they can power Microsoft AI, they can power your project. Inference, Laura, fine-tuning, anything you need, go to Nebius and get it. Use code AI Studio 20 to get $20 in credits for free right now. Check them out. Let me know what you think.",
