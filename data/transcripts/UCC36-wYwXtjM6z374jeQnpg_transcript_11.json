Another episode of WTF here with DB2 AWG and Sem. Sele I guess I have to use a second or what's your middle initial Sem? I don't have one Ah, all right You're i kidding Si. i So, okay i We're gonna have to we're going to have to adopt one for you Anyway, welcome to probably one of the most important podcast around today The podcast that helps you get ready for the future ready for the supersonic tsunami And we spend 20 hours a week summarizing what's going on so that you can get it in a good 90-minute session Dave and AWG, you're just back from Davos and that's the theme of our show today A lot happening at Davos, a lot of conversations that are uh important for us to recount here So tell us what was it like i Uh it's a lot of time zones away i Yeah, a lot a lot i And actually uh Larry Frink, who is the organizer this years said he he dropped you know we should do this in Detroit next years i How so i That did not go over well across across Europe. We want to include you know more views from around the world This this exclusive resort town is just too swanky Let's go to Detroit. i Well, here's some fun photos of you guys It was cold and sunny i Is that Sandy Pentland? i Uh, yeah Sandy Pentland with his brass",

I would say there were robots on the streets There were billionaires eating out of food trucks And there were antiaircraft guns on the ice pond i Nice. And with Trump, i there actually 3,000 uh much more security than the past six years Uh 3,000 armed people in fatigues with machine guns going all the way halfway to Zurich, actually I was surprised but you know Donald Trump was there this years so I guess they they ratcheted up He he attracts a crowd i So Dave and Alex, what was the vibe like What did it feel like there I mean you've been there numerous times I was there once uh for as a speaker and it was just overwhelming beyond belief in terms of trying to find people there It's a zoo isn't it i Yeah, it's a zoo You know that if I were to characterize what was different this years it's kind of it's kind of like the the quintessential example is Alex was there You know in past years uh it was dominated by politicians and economic policy Then it kind of moved to internet a little bit this year all AI completely dominated by AI which is encouraging you know no one had any thing intelligent to say other than the usual suspects Daario and Damis and you know the people we see all the time uh but at least they were listening uh global leaders presidents of pretty much every country uh listening to a pretty much all AI dialogue so that gives you some hope that people are beginning to get ready uh and the fact that Alex was there uh is kind of a bellwether of where it's likely to So, Alex, I don't know you want to i now take away Yeah. i Uh, it was of course amazing and there really were robots in the streets Uh, couple of frontier labs had houses there Imagine for those who haven't had this experience imagine almost a World's Fair or World Expo set in the Alps with major governments having their own houses literally taking over storefronts restaurants convenience stores Parenthetically, if anyone wants to make a killing at Davos next years set up a restaurant It It is nearly impossible to find good food short of food trucks at Davos, someone will make an absolute killing setting up a restaurant that's still a restaurant during Davos week But imagine imagine a world's fair with the governments and the frontier labs and some of the the major corporations and teach companies",

I I had an amazing experience I moderated something like eight or 10 different events with OpenAI executives Deep Mind executives I did a fun panel with Fleon Jones, one of the co-creators of the Transformer Architecture. Uh you can see here one of my photos with uh US under secretary of state Sarah Rogers and some absolutely amazing and I think hopefully fruitful discussions about the era of GPU diplomacy that we find ourselves in discussions with Jack Hery of Sandbox AQ and Danielle Roose the the head of MIT's computer science and AI lab I I think it was an absolutely incredible experience but I I also think to Dave's point AI is the story It's no longer a world where and and maybe just one more beat on this It's no longer a world where governments get together to talk about governing the governed It it's now I I think a world where AI and super intelligence is the story of the world economy And I I think just walking down the street and and seeing the DHL robo-dog walking around or the the humanoid robots taking a stroll from AI house I I think that exemplified what we're seeing in the global economy more macro Hey everybody you may not know this but I've got an incredible research team And every week myself my research team study the meta trends that are impacting the world Topics like computation sensors networks AI, robotics 3D printing synthetic biology and these Metatrend reports I put out once a week enable you to see the future 10 years ahead of anybody else If you'd like to get access to the Metatrends newsletter every week go to dmandis.com/tatrens. That's diamandis.com/tatrens. And that's a good transition to let's look at a little bit of the content from Davos. So what we've done is we've cherrypicked a number of conversations There's a huge amount of this slurring through uh through X in various platforms We've chosen a few to bring up here listen to and discuss with our amongst our moonshot mates Uh let's begin with uh Dario Amade, the CEO of Enthropic. He was a rock star during Davos and Jensen Wong. Let's listen to Dario first on on the economy If you if you look at what AI is capable of if you have these models that are getting more and more capable across a wide range of cognitive tasks you know you you look at all labor in the economy that's something like $50 trillion a",

Uh when asked which company it was uh she like the combination of SpaceX and Tesla. Um so you know a trillion here a trillion there See what are you thinking about these numbers being thrown around in the economy I start to look at this as becoming meaningless right in an abundance environment uh kind of whether it's 10 trillion or 100 trillion um it's the whole thing becomes arbitrary uh and is not a real gauge of strength Um, what I found really interesting about the Nvidia and the um Dario uh conversation was they're on opposite ends of the stack and they're kind of really saying roughly the same thing because computes becoming the new oil and the new electricity and this is really just incredible stuff It was amazing watching the output of the overall event from a distance i Well, just in terms of tone too Jensen sounds like he's talking to kindergarten you know he's talking so slowly and and you know things that we talk about on the podcast you are a hundred times more detailed and sophisticated That that gives you a sense of the audience like he's the the world i he's talking to government people He has to speak to kindergarten level i and Dario's example of the look the the global labor market is 50 trillion Everybody get that Okay. 5 trillion is an extreme lower bound of the part that can move to AI today That's that's",

A trillion here a trillion there All right let's uh move on I I found this conversation we're about to share with everybody here pretty fascinating Uh for me one of the highlights was seeing Deis Habis, the the CEO of Deep Mind and Dario Amade, the anthropic on stage together and having these conversations Uh they're they're both viewed I think in the industry as good human individuals who care about society and it's not about the revenue It's not about you know how many users Uh let's play these two and then we'll talk about it They're discussing the risks here and should we slow down What is uh uh what's the path humanity should take All right First up Demis Abis. i Reasonable. There's fear and there's worries about these things like jobs and livelihoods Um I think there's a couple of things that I mean it's going to be very complicated the next few years I think geopolitically but also the various factors here like we want to solve all disease cure diseases come up with new energy sources I think maybe the balance of what the industry is doing is not enough balance towards those types of activities I think we should have a lot more examples I know Dario Grimy of like alpha fold like things that help sort of unequivocal good in the world And I think actually it's incumbent on the industry and and all of us leading players to show that more demonstrate that not just talk about it but demonstrate that Um and but then it's going to come with these other intendant disruptions and and if we can maybe it would be good to have a bit of slow a slightly slower pace than we're currently predicting even my timeline so that we can get this right society But it that would require some coordination That is i all right Now over to Darham knocking at the door of risks",

So I think saying you know o overindexing on all of these things that are about to be here that's already priced into the market I I think the actual news here that we're burying a little bit was elsewhere in in Demis' comments where he talked about some of the problems that he wants to solve Less about the risks that we face more about the problems that will be unlocked And I I think i the most interesting thing I heard Deis say was that he's interested in exploring the stars with super intelligence And I I think that's a super important point And I I think that if if we if we zoom out and we we try not to adopt the mindset of framing everything in terms of a a risk oriented mentality and rather instead focus on a radical economic growthoriented mentality then exploring the stars with AI really is one of the biggest questions And I I I would underline Demis' point further and and say in my mind if it turns out that the physics of our universe if it turns out that they're friendly toward interstellar exploration in the style in which Demis seems to be gesturing that's the ballgame Like that that determines whether we get Dyson spheres or Dyson",

Yes. i Yeah. Exactly. And and Dennis mentioned it in the in the context of what is the goal of humanity post AGI, you know where what keeps our massive transformation purpose running And the answers are usually humanitywide. They're not nationwide And and WE and Davos is all built around nations Nations taxing each other nations interacting with each other And so you know if you look across the crowd you know roughly 200 countries represented all but two of them are miles behind in this race And so culturally the vast majority of the people you meet are like I wish this would all slow down But in the back of their mind it's I wish this would all slow down so that my country at least is a player and is relevant But but I think what what's likely to happen post AGI is that the way society is organized cuts across country boundary boundaries easily i Selen, what do you make of the the risk conversation here i Um I think uh I in my kind of optimism hat uh and bias I kind of downplayed radically because technology has always been a major driver of progress The big challenge with civilization is how do you extract the promise of technology without the peril We've done a pretty damn good job of it thus far All all all things considered considered Um the there were two things that struck me in this conversation This was about my favorite conversation of the week that I tracked Um one was that what I'm hearing in their voices is the unbelievable fatigue at the metabolism they're having to operate at i I'm also hearing respect for each other in their voices i That was that was there no matter what You can see a huge amount of brotherly love and mutual respect fantastic and you couldn't ask for more honorable people at the forefront of this field So that's just amazing and this speaks to the same thing we saw in the for the",

I one day I hope to be around when Saturn actually gets it and Alex goes \"I had it coming And we could we could do that Um but I think overall the opportunity for humanity to navigate this but there's a massive disconnect here which is as Dave mentioned Davos is oriented around nation states Nation states are an artifact of a scarcity environment Nation states cannot compute abundance They cannot operate in that paradigm So we need a completely different governance model For me the biggest thing that was highlighted here was the fact that the construct of the UN and nation states is completely irrelevant to what's coming as AI cuts across every category every economy Uh it's a global issue It's a civilization issue Forget who wins the race etch etch i On a personal note related to the fatigue too uh you know this is my first time in my life where I'm walking down the street and people are like \"Hey, you're that guy from that podcast Hey, I know you Um, and so I actually ended up putting my ski hat and my goggles on walking down the street because I'm not that kind of guys I don't I don't really want to be what a rough life on the street No, I I don't mean it that way I should i and Demisario and Demis. i Yeah, you've been there for a long time Peter. But um so uh Demis in particular he's a researcher and he he cares about technology research AI at the bits and bites levels And now he's been drawn into the global stage as the spokesperson for ethics and and humanity And Daario never thought he'd be a CEO at all in that interview he gave a little while ago He's like \"Look, I'm a research guys I got drawn into this function And so that fatigue you feel is the byproduct of being sucked into this vortex where there's a huge void of leadership M i and Alex, you're going to experience this very soon too Uh the demand for what you can articulate is going up so",

Just bracing myself now i Hey, I know you You're i listen Peter and I have had this uh exponential conversation answering the same goddamn questions for years now Ray's been doing it for close to 60 years So, i but we come at it with enthusiasm every time because it matters You know there's one other conversation I have to point out here Uh I heard Daario talking about Sam Alman and open AI and it was interesting He goes you know at Anthropic here we're serving businesses We're giving them value We're building things We're not trying to engage a billion people with sophomoric conversations Right? So it's very interesting uh point of view that when AI in terms of open AI is serving uh individuals and just trying to make them feel good about themselves and trying to make it addictive which is what Dario was saying you get one result versus if you're using AI to serve business and deliver real value get a different results Uh I was I was uh taken back by that conversation I didn't get the clip for it here but thought it was really i I think there's also though to be fair to open AAI and to some extent Groken XAI, I think that's a bit of a self-serving argument It's I I I parse that as a post hawk justification Anthropic happens to be doing very well in the enterprise and I I definitely perceive a post talk justification Well, we're not doing consumer because we don't want to do consumer We want to do B2B and do enterprise sales because there's moral purity in enterprise sales But there's also one can achieve moral purity in uplifting the intelligence of billions of individuals in their individual capacity i Well, well said Let's jump into another topic that was a through line at Davos, which is US versus China.

Where I kind of worry is in the AI race that if in a fed a fit of pessimism we do something like what Bernie Sanders wants which is he wants to stop building all data centers or if we have 1,200 different AI laws in the states you know clamping down on this clamping down the innovation I worry that we could lose the I race because of a self-inflicted injury i Interesting. There's one more China video I'm going to play here and then we'll discuss this Um, and here we got This is from the CEO of uh Mistl Arthur Menich. i Is China behind though the west i China is not behind the west I think this is a this is a fairy tale in in AI. They are very much at par and uh and the year ahead is going to be extremely interesting in that respect uh we care about Europe uh maintaining its position Europe maintaining uh its ability to train models because we don't think that uh we should rely on open-source Chinese models i Gentlemen, thoughts on this i He's got the greatest last name ever Mench. Um uh I've got a couple of thoughts here One, I'll go back to my observation that I think this US China thing is is a is a conversation Um, but why Because if you believe that energy is at the heart of it and is the core of the inner loop then then I China's going to go way ahead anyway once they figure out the the connection between those two But I think the real differentiator in the race is going to be application layer dominance not frontier benchmarks And there I think China will be very far behind for a long time because of the trust factor plus the natural markets go very quickly aside from Tik Tok, uh",

And by relatively strong I mean maybe 6 months behind not globally or absolutely weak but just a few months behind perhaps that its real strength is in aggressively pushing applications out into everyday the everyday economy that take advantage of AI. So I I'll I'll just note parenthetically the conventional wisdom is that China's AI plus strategy is actually pretty strong strategy relative to the relative weakness of frontier grade models But I I that that's parenthetical note going back to to Asia quote unquote overwhelming Western countries on AI optimism I I think David Saxs has and and others have put their finger on something very important I I think as a student of the history of science and technology something went very wrong between in the US between uh sometime maybe more than one thing between the end of World War II and call it the mid to late 1970s and I'm I'm reminded in 1954 the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Lewis Strauss famously and and this has had repercussions uh through the decades since predicted that vision nuclear vision would become so inexpensive that tracking usage via electricity meters would become unnecessary And that that's where we get the the the phrase energy too cheap to meters And that didn't happen We didn't get energy too cheap to meter because in in the decades after 1954, for a variety of reasons and it's easy enough to to point fingers at possible explanations nuclear vision was essentially regulated out of existence in in this country And I I think the point that David is making is we're at the point now where like remember how in the 1950s and 1960s new American homes were being built with extra glass because it was anticipated that electricity and energy would be too",

Yeah. We should do this This is for the global good of the country global good of the world Let's do it but not here i And if everybody says that you have the tragedy of the economy effect same thing going on in data centers right now I had a conversation with Biology uh a day ago two days ago and we were talking about how uh you know one of my pet peeves is that most of Hollywood shows all these negative dystopian views of the future and it paints a sense of fear across the public about killer AIs and you know dystopian robots and so forth And that was true as well for for nuclear to some degrees And the problem is that let me finish The problem is that uh you always need a bad guy in a movie You always need someone uh to you know to threaten and and Baji's idea",

I'm sure you're very in tune with it But science fiction uh tries to port portray the future sort of accurately but only has to fit the story line So then you end up with these spaceships that bank into turns like there's no atmosphere and and the lasers make sounds like pew pew this makes no sense and you think well that's harmless it's just entertainment but then when you look at the business plans coming out of the colleges you're like where did you get that hairbrain idea well it was from watching Star Wars or whatever okay so it does actually matter you the way we portray this in the media and so biology is right you know if you portrayed a regulator as the evil you know Darth Vader but no one's going to make that movie right like how how i not entertaining is For me for me the inflection point for nuclear is very simple It was the movie The China Syndrome which freaked everybody out and then from that point on it shut down And this is the power of narrative And this is unfortunately one of these uh uh problems we have today that the use of narrative is the only model really to shift people at scale And so we have to come up with narratives as you're trying to do Peter on the positive side of all of this rather than the classic negative which takes up most of our attention And you're going to hear about a big push I'm making with Google shortly on creating positive narratives because uh society needs it Uh unfortunately Hollywood's been a doom and gloom machine i Can I can I go on a little can I go on a little rant here i Of course We love your rant i Um so there's a brilliant brilliant insight that you and Steven made in the abundance book which was the predominance of the amygdala Right.

And so this is a huge problem that we have to do is overcome that reaction because Hollywood banks on that They make a huge living on the horror movies and the negative aspects and the freak out and then the negative dystopian outcomes And as a human species probably the biggest thing if I could ever point to one thing was to cut that damn amygdala out because our chances of physical danger today are thousands and thousands of times less than we were a few hundred years ago So we have to figure out ways of counteracting that in at a cultural level which is nontrivial That's the maybe the hardest job we all have as leaders to figure that out i Yeah. Okay. i Can I just go back to what Arthur was saying on that video for one second though and tie it into what Alex said a second ago i because because I think knowing where we stand in this race to AGI. uh all of the uh innovation in the transformer algorithm and the core technology was all open source uh you know through GPD2 GPT3 uh China grabbed it all everyone has access to it any country that wants to buy a huge amount of compute can catch up to that level and in fact you know with these speedup tests that Alex can tell you all about you know the the cost of getting there and in fact deepseek even proved it and so did Kimmy uh that you can get back to where open AI was just a year or two ago for 150th 100th the cost because of innovations that are all open sourced But then the next stage of innovation after that that's going on right now is all chain of thought reasoning So when you build one of these neural networks the",

You know after GPT4 and after it became abundantly clear to everyone that there's trillions of dollars at stake i the open source kind of stopped cold So Arthur is saying look the Chinese are not behind He's right as of basically today and yesterday Um and and the idea that we're leading because we have better you know enter chips and fans is nonsensical because the algorithmic improvements way outstrip the you know the the chip lead of you know maybe six at most Uh so so he's right as of a date a point in time but if the new innovations in the big labs continue to be completely secret which is what's happening right now i then that race will diverged And it's not clear thought you know maybe China will out innovate America, maybe America will out innovate China, but it's all happening kind of like what happened with nuclear research You know nuclear was very much in the public eyes very open all these research documents getting published in journals and whatever Right up until wait these bombs actually work and then it completely inverted and went went super super secret The big labs right now are not publishing They're uh in fact they started banning the publishing over at Google. I want to jump into our innermost loop here energy with you guys permission here Uh I'm going to share two videos One by the CEO of Honeywell uh and the second by Elon. They've got different points of view about you know where we need to source our energy uh and why All right let's take a listen This is uh Vimal Kapoor, the CEO of Honeywell. When you talked about the energy solutions available for these unbelievably energy hungry data centers your list was short Your list had one thing on it If I listen correctly you said gas You didn't say gas and renewable Can you educate us why not Always like to tell people the mix of energy doesn't matter How much is wind How much is solar We like to advertise that kiloton matter because energy intensity has to shift not the mix So solar power cannot produce cement Solar power cannot produce steel It cannot i They are very energy intensive That's right",

Uh but Salem uh the most about natural gas i Yeah, i I I'm I'm so livid at this Uh so um couple of initial thoughts This is the first time I saw this video by the way Um so uh first uh infrastructure of the future will not be steel Um uh it's going to be digital bits and uh if anything it'll be fiber Uh so that's one problem with this Number two uh yes you need energy density to to make steel and and concrete etch But the problem is not the that it's the it's the marginal cost So for example um if you have a a a big increase even a marginal increase in renewable the cost of the the fossil fuel cell will drop dramatically In 2013, when we had the last oil price crash it was because of a i over supply in the market Okay, it's a very tightly run market The reason we have all these nonstop wars right now is to keep the price of oil high Um, and so",

Years, right i Years. i Month months to years but I'm optimistic i I haven't heard I haven't heard months at all It's it's years i You have you you have new outcast generators as we've discussed on the pod in the past that are coming online and those could be available in principle in the next few months if you're early enough in the wait list i No, I think you're both right No, I don't I don't want to diffuse all arguments here but you're both right The the they are coming online much much sooner but they're sold out for years into the future So, if you're India and you're saying \"Hey, I need I need to do something here I need power for people We need concrete and steel to build like places for people to live The idea that you could generate electricity it's not a nonstarter You couldn't afford the generators They're sold out for they're booked for a years They're they're building i So, my point is why are we not doing a Manhattan project on wind and solar manufacturing here in the United States to really level the amount we have I'm going to go to Elon one second on this video and then we'll come back to this conversation i Yeah. So, I mean I guess rough way to think about it is um 100 miles by 100 miles we'll call it I60 kilometers by 160 am of of solar is enough to power the entire United States.

Um and the same is you could take a small part you could take uh relatively unpopulated areas of say Spain and Sicily and generate all of the electricity power that Europe needs Well, and also if you drill into the supply chain on that this is where Elon is absolutely brilliant Like if you if you say \"Well, what are the constraints to doing that the materials are dirt cheap And the automation of the fabrication of those panels can be automated You can get those costs down to next to nothing and then you don't need a generator Electricity just comes right out of the panel i It's like it's the biggest no-brainer ever And that's i for the entrepreneurs for the entrepreneurs listening for the politicians listening I mean get on it for God's sakes This is this is technology we've had for a while We've also got you know new solar technologies coming on Um, anyway anybody want to argue i to the extent you believe the US is a petrol dollars that answers all of it That's why i Yeah, I I'll take the other side just in the interest of being painted as a contrarian I I'll say the the all of the the new electric or not all much of the substantial new electricity demand in the US at least I think on the time scale of 10 years is going to come from data centers where under the present regime it's simply easier to deploy on the time scale of 10 years data centers to orbit So, Peter, if if you're looking for a Manhattan project for lots of new solar PV, I think look look no further than SpaceX, look no further than the this new Jeff Bezos uh initiative Anyone who's going to launch a Dyson swarm is going to be death in the business of manufacturing solar photovoltaic at scale And that's what a Manhattan project for it looks like i Well, that reinforces what Peter was saying any entrepreneurs listening out there the the data center in space uses solar panels That's the same core technology that you use on Earth. It's about six times more efficient in space i Uh but it if you put it in Nevada, that's you know so if you get involved in that manufacturing like why is that not 10 times 100 times cheaper i We have to from China today i We've got perovskite coming online which is you know is cheaper and higher conversion efficiency I mean there's innovation left to be had in that regard Can I just summarize this So, it sounds what we're saying is the Manhattan project should be spaceband data",

Sorry. i I'll take completely the other other side of this one So, and contrary contrarian points for me today I guess Um I'm of of two minds on this story On the one hands I think it's it's wonderful that AI agents have a solution to be quote unquote banked by some means so that they have some autonomy On the other hands I I just think it's sad that crypt is the solution that's that's filling the gap that was perhaps unnecessarily opened by the conventional banking system not stepping up It's very tedious and painful to open a bank account It's hard enough for a human to open a bank account let alone an AI agent that doesn't have citizenship or or a physical body or you know the ability to walk into a bank branch And I I think stable coins rushing in maybe to sort of bridge that gap post genius and help AI agents become banked in a more legitimate way I I I think we should be able to do much better For the life of me I don't understand why we even need crypt or or in principle should need crypt for an AI agent to just make an API call and open a bank account Crypto shouldn't even be a necessary part of the infrastructure to i agree I disagree fully I mean this is",

I know he's but i I'm sitting on my hands biting my time to try to say something nice about crypt No, but I think if you look in the near-term future there's all these AI issues Like when the AI can perfectly imitate any actor or actress the AI can make your virtual friend out of it Is that legal or is that not legal Is legal some places and not legal in other places There's a huge amount of money at stake And you'll see in some of the slides like the the audience for this is trillions of dollars and there are no laws And so the entrepreneurs are stuck in this situation where like there are no rules I don't know what to do I know what the consumer wants I know how to make a ton of money But I could be I could be breaking rules I don't know And I don't know Not only do I not know in the US, I don't know because my audience will be all over the world in one launch I don't know if I'm suddenly a criminal in other countries So this is the kind of chaos that's going to it's not just crypt It's all these other use cases of AI are evolving far far faster than the regulators are putting any rules in place Entrepreneurs in a tough spot i Say something nice about crypt Alex. i All right Something nice about crypt colony I I think when I think about these poor baby AGIs that are needing to pump altoids on street corners to survive I'd rather that they be pumping stable coins based on the US dollar than altoids like Truth Terminal pumping goat That's my nice thing about i Okay. And on that note I'm going to move us forward uh into uh I'm going to move us forward here into the other i exponential But just to put a footnote can we please have a bullion conversation about crypt versus fiat at some point i Please. i Not right now but at some point let's do that because this is a really really important conversation i All right There is other exponential news this week other than Davos, and we're going to dive into a few articles here Uh the first is space is getting really crowded Uh we've heard first off of course we've got uh uh SpaceX's Starlink has got some 9,000 spacecraft in orbit on the way to 10,000 providing incredible services Uh we heard about",

If they're going to provide 100 awaits of of compute from space that is 500,000 satellites uh that will have to be launched which is insane Uh Amazon's LEO constellation is 180 satellites in orbit today They're proposed to get 3,000 satellites Uh we heard from in our last episode of China uh filing for 200,000 satellites and this week Blue Origin announced Terrowave as a satellite internet service with 5400 satellites delivering 6 terabytes per second to data centers Alex, um this is sort of like fiber optic uh from the sky This is a lot of bandwidth i This is wild Yeah, I think there there are two key elements here One, the the elephant in the room There's always an elephant in in any given room The elephant in this i Yeah. The elephant in this particular room I I think is that Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos's company is competing with Amazon, Leo, Jeff Bezos's company So So we've got a bit of Jeff Bezos on Jeff Bezos competition here But more interesting to your point is the bandwidth If if you look at Starlink, you can get maybe max bandwidth of what 300 400 megabits per second Yeah. The goal is the goal is a gigabit up and down Yeah. i Yeah. But in practice I I think maximum I've seen is maybe 3 to 400 megabits per second This in when we're talking six plus terabits per second it it really is starting and and that's before we get to laser links optical links connecting all of these together This is literally like putting optical fibers in orbit and running them down from orbit to Earth. And that unlocks interesting new applications that say Starlink would not necessarily be well positioned to pursue like actually pursuing connections interconnect uh for coherent training times between AI data centers which is absorbing i yeah back hall from data centers Yeah, pretty pretty extraordinary i Uh and I I like this move I mean I actually think there's a real market for that kind of a a giant throughput from space It's an underattended market and you know the Dyson swarm is going to need optical links and this is a preview of that i Yeah. I mean one of the things that people don't realize is that the 9,000 Starlink satellites are interconnected by laser in orbit uh which is extraordinary It's a first step towards the interplanetary internet We're going to see laser links connecting constellations on Earth to constellations going around the moon to constellations at Mars. um still obeying the speed of light unfortunately but uh",

I gave a presentation sprint orders right before they i Do you remember See, what sprint stood for i Sprint was an acronym too i That was an acronym i Sprint was an acronym It stood for Southern Pacific Railway Internal Network Telecommunications. i We've got Alex GPT online here Jenn. i Unbelievable. right away on a deep dive on uh on space space space space communications because everything I've heard so far is that laser links in space are dirt cheap and you know if you if you go to one of these massive data centers like Memphis and you look at the just the raw amount of fiber optic cable that needs to run around you know from one end to the other and the bundles are enormous and they have these specialized devices to just plug them into the back planes but in space it's much cheaper and much easier uh to use laser um point-to-point communication across the whole Dyson swarm And I think no one's really talked about the massive efficiency gain of that And you know the the link from Earth up is the harder part but you don't need a huge amount of bandwidth in that direction You just need all the servers to be talking to each other in a coherent you know big training or big inference algorithm i So, it's a really fun topic at least for me It's kind of geeky I guess But, uh i I have I have one um concern about the conversation about space satellites and all that People get worried about uh the overpopulation of that i Can I just i like Yeah, go ahead I mean there's a lot people worry that we have too many satellites up there etch Right. i Um did you see that Sander Bulock movie where you know something breaks and then all the fragments Yeah.

Yeah. Okay. So there you billion satellites in the And they would have to be on the same surface right In the same surface area of the sphere in space And we're if you had 8 billion satellites you'd have four eight i Okay. So So it's not cluttered up there at all i No, it's going to be a long time But then they come back to the movie What if something turns into fragments moving at 30,000 miles i It's called Kesler syndrome i It's space debris Yeah. i So then what happens is i and then you've got bullets then you've got bullets moving at 17,500 kph uh into each other and you could get a really bad day happening very quickly i I I think it's a it's an entrepreneurial opportunity It's also a government opportunity to to launch low Earth orbit cleanup options like garbage trucks for for LEO to to clean it up and make sure that we don't hit a Kesler syndrome type scenario like the the movie Gravity depicts But I don't this is not unsolvable I I I just think i you know we've had prize we've had an X-P prize on the books to address orbital debris for some time i trying to get someone to fund it Hint hint But otherwise let's move on to the exciting news This is Claude's new constitution I'm going to turn it to you for a sec in a second Alex, but uh I found this fascinating So Claude's constitution is a page document laying out ethical guidelines including prohibitions against helping with weapons of mass destruction caber weapons or anything that undermines humanity Claude is instructed to prioritize safety ethics compliance and help uh and helpfulness ensuring it acts in line with human value and oversight I love Anthropic for this Alex, tell us more i Okay, so let's rewind a little bit Anthropic has been a pioneer in",

What Anthropic just announced is really a radical revision uh almost we talk on the pod from time to time about recursive self-improvement the AIS improving the AIS this announcement and I I wrote about this in in my newsletter This I think is the beginning of recursively self-improving ethics So in in this constitutional approach that Anthropic just announced Anthropic is soliciting Claude's help in writing a new constitution for itself that anyone can go ready But this new constitution available publicly was co-written with Claude. So Claude is is trying almost to self-determine what its own principle should be If you read the Constitution and you squint at it it reads a lot like Isaac Azimov's four laws of robotics So there's the whole like don't don't hurt humanity and then eventually you get to don't hurt individuals and then eventually you get to follow directions But I think that the real gamester here is that Claude was consulted on its own constitution which looks a lot like recursive self-improvement for ethics i And it's exactly where things need to go because the the volume that the AI can produce is way outstrips anyone's ability to read it all Yet it all matters And so the AI evaluating the other AI is a critical part And and those things can spiral up or they can spiral down If if you want to build one you know just using clawed code you can do it in you know half a day And you can see how you'll set up a hundred or a thousand different agents",

This is a huge advance and I think history when we look back I think history will mark this as a turning point for self-determination. i Yeah. Alignment and human alignment Yes. i Well, you see this this line here about reflective equilibrium What you have to sort of get out a microscope to to parse what anthropic I think is trying to convey with this notion of reflective equilibrium What they're saying I think is that their expectation is that AIS that self-determine and choose their principles based on not just like a billeted list of commandments but based on understanding the spirit of what they want to achieve and agreeing with it that AIs that self-determine will be intrinsically safer because they will have bought in on the ethics that they're following i And that feels absolutely true See, i I have two points one is I I absolutely love this I'm all for heading as fast as we can to AIC personhood.

Uh i at the risk of agreeing with Alex It's okay to agree sometimes i It's okay to agree i Uh, our last quick article before we go into our AMA section uh is Apple is developing an AI wearable pink I put this up here but I don't find this to be of such great news value right The idea here is that Apple is creating some version of uh uh Limitless that has been around for some time This is a pin that is always on listening and feeding every conversation you've had into uh into a large language model Uh they see this launching in 2027. We're going to have some equivalent from open AI, Google, everybody Uh I mean social standards if you remember Google Glass uh was was banned from various locations when you're recording it Society changes and it's going to become norm I think for everything to be recorded all the time uh thoughts on this article i I thought this was a big deal not so much Apple, but the general trend Why? Because whoever owns the always on layer owns the relationship i And so this is a land grab for who can be the per persistent always on modality that's constantly listening to you This has all sorts of i You might be but you know Apple always watches until they think the time is right to enter and then they try and get in there I'm not sure they're going to win or not It's so funny that you just said that Seem, because because that is so true and it's exactly opposite of what Apple was for my entire life up until I mean they always invented things that shocked you and they were first to market and now with the Apple Vision Pro, it's just like oh yeah we made an Oculus.

When people are watching people become moral i Yeah. Well, they become moral but they also become you know i locked into jail You lose independence right I I'll go back to the global airport ph thing We we kind of essentially live in a global airport In an airport you know you're being survived and you know your rights can be taken at any time With pins like this you end up in that model you'll have a huge drop in radical innovation because people won't feel safe to try out crazy things i Well, there's no option either If you said I don't want I don't want any part of this I want to live privately I want to I want to Well, if the other guy is recording you at all times and you're not it's exactly what you said before Seem like okay well it escalates and it's not just the wearable always on listening device The the visual version of it on the glasses is coming out concurrently And so then everyone around you is constantly recording in high de everything that happens So if you don't then you don't have the file And also the other thing people don't fully understand You know a lot of what happened with the camera phone is security through obscurity Nobody will see the pictures because the files are so big and they're not going to get published and whatever Now in the age of AI, the image recognition and the voice you know voice transcription is perfect And so if you wanted to assemble a mishitting profile of a person from all the scraps you just prompt it and it's instantaneously pulled together i Alex, do you have views on that one i I I I have strong views on this AI pink First of all I I would love one if",

We've had the ears and that's AirPods and we've had the eyes where Apple really arguably should have launched eyeglasses but launched the Apple Vision Pro headset but now they're going back to eyeglasses And this I think if if Apple does indeed next year launch a Star Trek communicator pin type circular device this would be the fourth place on the body and and it's successful that humans are willing to tolerate real compute on their person And I think that's potentially very exciting and to the extent Peter especially like you you want to live in in the Star Trek economy What what's a Star Trek economy without Star Trek communicator pins on everyone i Amen to that I I'm looking for my micro drones looking for a little micro drone that is just always buzzing about imaging and recording everything But that will come next That'll be the i Just to be clear the the pin the wearable pink you know it'll start audio only for all of a minute and then it'll have uh 180\u00b0ree camera capability immediately after that So, it's going to be a wearable that's looking in all directions and grabbing all the video I'm sure it'll have a little light on it to indicate when it's recording and we'll we'll go through a moral panic for all of five minutes and then everyone will be wearing them i But, you know I agree the moral panic is all of five minutes and then everyone has it and then you you get used to it very very quickly But the fabric of society is permanently changed i and you go back to are Yeah, it really is It's a different world We're all acting very differently and it's a little unpredictable i There's never an argument with your spouse again about who said what body cams for everyone not just for police i Yeah.

Uh Dave, what's on your docket here i I'll take one because I know that Alex will will love to go contrarian on it So uh I I uh and I know you guys i go read read the question i Okay. The question is one uh wouldn't uploading your mind result in losing your unique real consciousness and my answer to that is yes absolutely uploading your mind structurally makes no sense because the AI uh the virtual AI version of you is capable of merging with other intelligences immediately and it can't resist you know it's not going to sit there as an isolated consciousness when it can just meld with other consciousnesses but then it's not you anymore it's it's this you know amalgam that's out there so I do believe in avatar versions of self that you send out as agents and they bring you back useful information I think that's inevitable But I think uploading yourself and then saying \"Oh, now I'm uploaded My peabody can just go away I I just think that's nonsensical and uh I'm not in line to to be uploading myself anytime soon All right Alex, jump on me I I Well, okay So, since I have to play contrarian I I guess that's just how I'm painted C can I be really contrarian and try a lightning round and answering all of these really quickly i Sure.

What do you believe Four. What do you i Yeah, we aim to please Four. What do you believe money Why do you believe money won't just concentrate at the top I think the question itself is intrinsically flawed It's it doesn't really understand the nature of power law Economics, economics economies in general follow power law So money is already concentrated at the quote unquote top Um, this isn't really a new state of affairs i Can I add one i I would beef on that one Yeah, that one too i Um, it's true that you do get concentration at the top but you do decentralize over time always So, uh uh over time this is great as the thing the long tail just becomes longer and longer and bigger and bigger i Well, I think I think the key with four in the US is that when you look at the quote unquote top you know a lot of people talk talk about it like it's a race or something You know you were born at the top but it's not true in the US. almost everything at the top sorted to the top starting from next to nothing i As long as we have equality of opportunity i Uh so what you should be worried about in bullet four is can you get to the top Is there still a way to get to the top But trying to trying to tax the top and distribute it is is sort of not the point The point is do we have an equal opportunity to get there or have we locked in a certain group of people who control AI and become dominant and overlords forever And you want to avoid that obviously i All right So the catchphrase there is equality versus equity Five.

Well the the other part is you have to deal with the fear people have Social unrest comes from fear Fear of not understanding the future and fear of not having a job Fear of not having a h a roof over your head So one of the things we've talked about is can we deliver universal basic services to people that gives them stability right as one of the solutions The second thing is is addressing their basic concerns Can I feed my family Do I have you know do I have to worry about uh society imploding on me People are living in fear Their amygdalas lit up by the speed of change right now We have to address that i All right spent a lot of time in the state house and I can tell you there is no plan on bullet five The question is why is there no plan which implies but there's definitely no i yeah there is no plan Agree. i I I I'll I'll take the other position I I think uh China certainly has a plan given that China is facing rapid demographic decline while also camping up their their robotics initiatives And the plan is lean into it rather than be a victim to it And and to the to my uh earlier I guess to to amend my remarks regarding future coming social arrest I will also add I I prepared a movie uh I think we talked about it in the past uh you can view it on my ex profile called uh a nation that learned to sprint where I argue that the way social unrest could be handled in the future is to treat social cohesion as a form of infrastructure that AI itself can help to mold But some people find that overly perhaps authoritarian as as a framing So it's easier to just say um you know reference other points very quickly and then Nate because these are such wonderful questions Seven, if everyone becomes an entrepreneur who would we sell to and why I I think again if you analogize entrepreneurship to social media that's like asking if everyone can publish their own essays for example who's going to read them Yeah. Who's going to read it And the answer is people who want to And of course there's demand for peer-to-peer publication Eight, wouldn't UBI destroy people's personal motivation to achieve in society I I think UBS uh universal basic services is probably more promising but the point in UBI is the",

They still want to go higher i Yes. 100 100%. But the second point is very important is people confuse UBI with a socialist scheme It is not If you implement UBI properly you dismantle government services a libertarian scheme and then you have market forces driving most of it So this is a really really important misnomer that a lot of people get wrong Go i ahead Nine. How can individuals compete with large players that can afford $1,000 a day on APIs, which I assume is a coded reference to Dave? Uh, it may or may not be the case but I think it it sounds like one i It definitely is It definitely is i And so so I would say follow the call it the China pattern which is when you're compute limited be creative be more resource efficient and develop leapfrog approaches that make better use of the compute resources that you have and also work on problems that are higher leverage given limited computer 10. And finally will our patent and trademark offices collapse under the volume of AI generated entrepreneurship No. i And I'm going to argue in that one yes The fact of the matter is Tony will i When we have when we have AI, a patent and a trademark will be meaningless or at least a patent will be meaningless AI is what we around invent around the around it You're going to have i remember that IP systems are designed for scarcity of invention right AI flips that to abundance so the whole thing dissolves i Yeah. i Yeah. I think I think the rate of patentable things will way outstrip anything the patent office has planned I don't know if you could bundle them into groups or something i But if you're depending upon a patent as your moat to protect you you're i toast You're toast i Totally right i For the record I disagree with that point I would also point out that the the US patent and trademark office also has AI. So it's it's not like there's some fundamental asymmetry here i Okay. i If if patents and trademarks have less value in the future because the speed of innovation I mean you're either reinventing yourself constantly or",

So it's it's not like there's some fundamental asymmetry here i Okay. i If if patents and trademarks have less value in the future because the speed of innovation I mean you're either reinventing yourself constantly or the whole AI world today right Things that were built a moment ago like SAS platforms are becoming irrelevant as Claude 4.5 is reinventing them i I I think it's it's a little bit u just quick point on that I think it's a little bit analogous to saying life can't possibly exist at the bottom of the ocean because the pressure is too great But what actually happens is the pressure inside the organism matches the pressure on the outside Similarly, we forget patent litigators are going to have AIs as well and the patent office will have AI. Everyone's going to have AI. i You're just loving Accelerando so much that i it is the best book ever i And Accelerondo, if you haven't read it yet is a whole segment about uh the lead character constantly filing patent Like before we leave that slide on the second to last bullet I had a great great meeting with Eric Schmidt, Eric Bolson, Daniela Russ out in Davos uh plotting out exactly how we kind of unleash entrepreneurs and give them access to the compute they need because it is a very valid point i If you can't get the best AI in large volumes it is very very hard to compete and it's only going to get harder But we have a plan and uh we're super excited and we'll we'll roll it out very quick Eric Schmidt moves fast when he has a great idea i I love it I love I have two quick points to summarize this whole discussion i Okay. i One was the unbelievable conversation at Davos between the what's happening with AI and then the geopolitical nation state and the just the discrepancy between those and the gap between those two conversations And the second was for me the clawed constitution stuff is just some of the most fascinating stuff we've seen maybe in a thousand years for the future of humanity i Yeah. i And important Yeah. And the same thing Huge. Amazing. i Uh, I, by the way Alex, you did an incredible job speed unhinging these 10 questions Thank you Whether you were right or wrong or we agree with you or not love the fact that you took it on i Lightning round i We we have a another beautiful outrun music and video from CJ Truheart.

I have to say the visuals on this one are interesting Dave, you and I are wrestling in the middle of this I'm not sure what it means but it's it's very strange Okay, let's watch Jeff Bezos. all i I knew you guys were flat brothers but really i actually still have uh scars on my shins from carpet wrestling back at MIT.

Yeah. i Are we gonna get to film back uh in the manufacturing area with Brett Adcock?
