        "text": " Science faces challenges of incredible scale, whether it's understanding our universe or deciphering the human genome to develop new medicines. To take on these challenges, Horizon is being built in Round Rock, Texas. The largest academic supercomputer in the U.S. and part of the NSF's new Leadership-Class Computing Facility, Horizon will be powered by NVIDIA technologies: Grace Blackwell Superchips, Vera CPUs, and Quantum-X800 InfiniBand to advance scientific AI and simulation. Its foundation will be Dell Integrated Rack Scalable Systems featuring Dell PowerEdge servers. With 100 times the AI performance of the Frontera supercomputer, Horizon will provide unprecedented power for science. At its heart is the NSF's Characteristic Science Applications program, large-scale science projects that are shaping Horizon from the ground up. Biochemists like Emad Tajkhorshid will use Horizon to simulate viral infections. Astrophysicists like Tom Quinn will trace the evolution of galaxies. And geophysicists like Yifeng Cui will advance earthquake modeling to improve seismic hazard maps. The Horizon supercomputer will support up to 15,000 global researchers a year on NSF-funded projects, accelerating the most innovative, high-impact initiatives to fuel discoveries not otherwise possible.",
