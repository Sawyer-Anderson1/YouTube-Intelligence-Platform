The the untapped but mobile capital is here in this room and if it jumps on the opportunity the it's like an opportunity I've never seen before Now that's a moonshots ladies and gentlemen All right welcome everybody to our AI mini summit i brought to you by Link Exponential Ventures. It's a pleasure to have you We're going to be having a series of 30inut conversations that look at AI investing where the next trillion dollar companies are coming from We'll be having a session of our moonshot summit And I'd like to open with our first session which is how will we fund the global AI revolution uh to enable this conversation It's a pleasure to bring on stage three leaders in this field David Blondon. David is my business partner He's a serial entrepreneur He is the managing partner of Link Exponential Ventures with 23 startups under his belt A long track record of a 44% iron a little over a billion dollars am based on the campus of MIT and Harvard. David Blondon, please come on up Take a seat here Thank you David. applause Next up is Bonnie Chan, CEO of the Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Hex since March of 2024, bringing over 30 years of global capital markets legal and listening transformation experiences Bonnie, please join us And finally on our panel this morning is Anjen Mida partner at Andre Harowitz A16Z investing in frontier AI open-source infrastructure uh the man who's backed anthropic on the board of Mistl welcome to the stage an MA. So how will we fund i take a load off here i the global AI revolution guys i So I mean when I think about it uh we are seeing today at least in the United States a billion dollars deployed per day i into AI. The expectations are we're going to see that growing to i billion a day by 2030. And I expect it's going to blow through that uh in fact I'm seeing capital flowing to the exclusion of a lot of other things i Uh let's open with opening thoughts",

And I expect it's going to blow through that uh in fact I'm seeing capital flowing to the exclusion of a lot of other things i Uh let's open with opening thoughts of the largest venture funds on the planet Uh what percentage of A16Z is flowing towards AI? Uh, and what are your what are your thoughts about about the capital availability to fund this you know infrastructure you know what I what we call on the Moonshots podcast tiling the earth in computer i right Uh, how much how much capital is flowing into AI? Basically, all of it and it's still not enough Um, because you know what the firm was founded to be a verticalized firm We have an infrastructure fund an applications fund a healthcare fund and all of those are now AI funds right because AI is a cross stack thing whether you're you're working with teams that were training foundation models or building applications I I don't think anybody is not an AI investor anymore Um on the other hands what's also insatiable is the is the need for these for AI businesses especially ones that generate tokens um that leverage the latest generation and reasoning models which generate 10 times more tokens than traditional you know gene models before reasoning the the the we're living through like Javon's paradox every day where no matter how much infrastructure buildup we do no matter how many um you know algorithm algorithmic efficiencies there are we somehow just need more computer more infrastructure to serve the state-of-the-art demand in text code image video It it's just sort of this insatiable explosion of use cases And I just don't think we figured out how to change the traditional venture capital stack to fund all this growth That's why you're seeing you know we try to fund entrepreneurs as much as we can but then we got to pull in all the friends we can whether that's Nvidia as a strategic who who invests on the cap tables directly alongside us It might be a data center provider There's just you know whether it's Satcha doing a billion dollar investment into micro into OpenAI as a nonprofit four years ago or it's Amazon and Google investing in anthropic There there's just all the rules are being rewritten about how you fund growth because we just need all the capital we can get Bonnie, I'm when I see an offering being made by Elon for XAI or by Anthropic or by Open AAI, instantly it's filled I mean people are fighting to get into these deals and no one's asking is the valuation is the deal going to make sense They're just throwing capital at this How are you seeing it from your perspective Well, first of all I do agree with the comment that Anjay made",

Um and and so you know how are we going to fund it I think there are many different ways but uh suffice to say you know given that you know Hong Kong stock exchange obviously we're in Asia and I would say um given the demographics there is an emergence of a lot of um uh well a big population of retail investors We tend to now call them propel investors with technology Now everyone have their own trading theories and strategies and whatnot and they can execute you know rather in a rather sophisticated manner So I must say that you know from my vantage point I still think whatever ways is available which can bring as many different pockets of demand right from different investors at all corners of the world will probably you know be a good way um to support the development of AI on the one hand and really quest that insatiable demand on the other hands So um to put things in context we've done quite well this year uh in the IPO space In fact Hong Kong is now number one on the global IP league table this years Uh we have we have 300 300 uh deals in the pipeline waiting to get done We have already done about 80 year to date And I would say of um the 80 which has been completed and the 300 which is still waiting in line about probably half of it has something to do with AI. Now there are different manifestation but I would say especially with the companies in the Chinese mainland these days if you are not already doing something with AI or being you know at the very um center of the AI development you're probably quite unable to compete and be successful in your business So this is sort of my answer to your question And I I think really um just given how much capital is needed to support the growth whether it's private whether it's public whether it's credit whether it's equity does not matter uh I think our common challenge will be to to make sure that you know we find as many ways as possible that we match the capital with the opportunities",

Uh what are you seeing as the growth of companies going into AI that is feeding the pipeline at the early stage Well, I'll tell you there's there's a reason Bonnie's on this panel and sandwiched between the startup guys because the amount of capital required coming into these companies like you said i billion a day coming up US venture is 200 billion a years So it's not even close You know five times more money needs to come from somewhere i And so as an said you know some of it comes from Nvidia, some of it comes from corporate venture But these companies like uh Meror, one of the ones in our portfolio uh valuations went founding 30 million 300 million 2 billion 10 billion i And how what in what time Two years i Two years So first of all the $10 billion number is unprecedented uh in eight or 10 years and what used to be incredibly rare is now incredibly abundant But the amount of capital uh going into the sector way outstrips the venture funds and so what we generally see is the corporate money the Nvidia money comes in to fill the void but the people working there an types they they say well this is really fun I'm glad I made that entropic investment but I'm going to go do my own fund So the the talent tends to eventually come out of the corporations and go into the two and 20 private sector to fill the space So I think that that trend is now drawing in a huge amount of money which is why we're talking about it on this stage in Saudi Arabia. The the untapped but mobile capital is here in this room and if it jumps on the opportunity the it's like an opportunity I've never seen before i Can we talk about the two sides of AI? One is the buildup of AI infrastructure right and the other is AI applications and the buildup of those applications Uh where do you see the capital split between those and the attractiveness to venture funds or public markets for those two things An i uh that's it's a it's a really interesting question because the last few years basically 3 four years were dominated by the infrastructure buildout, right So most of the capital that was going into startups was being converted directly to GPUs.

What's interesting now is you have a whole businesses you know where's we got Amjad right here building one right in the coding space and to build application businesses like that you not sometimes you need GPUs but other times you need tokens from other foundation models that's that's now a raw ingredient as well so the capital stack was just raw cache then came you'd you'd convert raw cache to GPUs and then the the foundation model teams converted the GPUs to tokens and that's an input now into application developers which is if you think about it way more of a scarce resource highquality tokens from foundation models is a much more scarce resource than raw GPUs and GPUs are a much more scarce commodity than raw cache i and so that's the prep stack I would say of compute do you see the demand for infrastructure buildup continuing and and accelerating or topping out i accelerating and not being able not accelerating fast enough because now the fundamental constraint is energy right We literally just don't have enough power density in most of the legacy data centers in in most regions of the world And you've got to go retool these data centers for GPUs. If you look at the new black welds from from Nvidia, you know all all the research scientists I talked to are really excited because it's it's got the NVL72 uh networking stack which means you can do a bunch of great big memory uh intensive training runs like video models And then you get down to the brass stacks of when can that data center actually go live when can we get it cabled when can we get the energy permits And that's way after when the chips can actually get there And so the info spend the infer needs are largely driven by demand forecasting As we discussed earlier demand is completely uncapped And meanwhile the compute supply chain is caught up by the energy the constraint hasn't The energy supply hasn't And so what we're living through right now is this frenzy for energy contracts where compute providers are trying to outbid each other to buy literally just clears throat energy supply i Yeah. Yeah. i So the depending on which part of the infrastruct you're talking about I don't see things slowing down from a from a from a funding perspective Like the cape going into this into infra is not slowing down but what we may be faced with a hard wall on is just energy scaling We just don't have enough electricity to power the chips i Bonnie, what are what are you seeing in the public markets in terms of energy",

You have a friend of mine going public on your exchange uh in silicon medicine in the next i I'm not allowed to comment on specific come Yeah. Well, anyways but yeah I think you see my point there right Any data intensive business will be a darling you know in this regard David, um you're seeing companies at inception you're seeing entrepreneurs brilliant entrepreneurs and I think you've commented that the number of startups coming out of MIT and Harvard in the AI world is like quadrupled in the last few years i Yeah, more than i uh what what kind of distribution what are you seeing Where are they going into application layers Uh, computer what are you seeing as the the categories the the companies coming out of MIT and Harvard are overwhelmingly going into vertical use cases and then also uh some foundation model companies like liquid AI will be on stage right after this So there are a few of those but many many more vertical use case companies and the success rate of those is near 100%. i And so they're attracted to first they're not super capital intensive i 100%. i Well so far for us uh MIT and Harvard teams that fit a profile are 100%. Uh I've never seen anything like it before and it's because the use cases are so abundant relative to the talent pool Uh so if you have the talent and you'd have to be crazy to go after a bad use case right now there just you can use AI for so many things It's very very different from crypt which was the last wave more similar to the internet i The internet is incredibly flexible can use it for many many things And you saw you know when I started investing in the late 1990s everything you invested in succeeded i Why? Well, because the internet can do almost anything And so unless you're insane in going after something really dumb you're going to succeed Uh, so I haven't seen that again in my lifetime until now And now it's the same thing And that the value is enormous Uh, and the teams are thriving every single time But they're really attracted to",

So, but that's relatively rare Most people go after the use cases i And how quickly are you seeing the valuations in those kind of companies scale i I mean it's in like Jayce Lock Miller. i No, in the in the companies and they're doing the vertical uh in the link studios Yeah. i I mean typical entry valuations are what they've always been maybe 20 $30 million First funding will be a hundred to 300 million uh and then within two years if you're going to be a unicorn you're going to get there in two years now i uh which means the founders now are still 23 24 years old uh so that's a new thing in the world too you know we have a bunch of people that I can name I think about my entire lifetime of investing can name like three or four people that I knew or invested in that hit billionaire under the age of 30 now I can name eight that we've invested in in just the last few years i it's like so there's this new class of person roaming around that barely has a driver's license but has a billion dollars in liquidity and So, so we have to kind of adapt to that i Used to be a billionaire Being a billionaire was a big deal Now, we're just going to wait for the millionaires to start i Oh, we're all born in the wrong age i Yeah. i Yeah. Yeah. i You know I want to understand what you guys consider the biggest risks uh over the next years Um is it compute cost inflation Is it talent scarcity Is it regulatory intervention We've been on this incredible inflationary and exponentially growing curve on all things AI. Uh just like used to be add.com on the end of your company i now it's like all we use AI. Uh an an what are you seeing as the risks i Um so on fundamental like progress of capabilities we already talked about the one energy which I'm concerned about but I think i double click on that So will will these companies have access to sufficient electrons to run the data centers Is it is it what what is the scarce resource in the in the chain i Um in the United States I think that's a direct function of whether the permitting regulations that the current administration is working on end up",

But I don't think we've really figured out what happens when the rest of the public goes \"Well, where's my piece of the future i Yes. i And I don't think we're ready I don't think we're talking about it enough And I don't think governments are doing enough to realize how dire it's about to get when 30% of your IT services GDP sector gets vaporized by tokens If you're India for example where double-digit percentages of your GDP are literally IT services what do you do when claude and GPT5 tokenism like vast portions of that flow We I think we love to talk about productivity growth and we don't talk about how to manage the short-term transition pains and that's going to be ugly i So that you're adding that to our risk profile civil unrest i Absolutely.

Yeah. Well, I completely agree with what an said and I'll I'll give you another parallel risk which is that you know the the core AI companies that do things like customer support white collar automation just killing it I mean adding immense amounts of value and the investment community coming in has started to extend that to oh teach is a good place Let me put 200 million into fusion energy You're like well that's not AI. Well, but it's going to create the electricity about four or five six years from now to fund to So, it's related to AI. I'm like well okay but that's very capital intensive and you're not sure it's going to work And so I think it will work and I think it's a good area to invest but if it doesn't work that's where you're going to have this What happened to the internet in 2000? The internet was very real And if you waited long enough it came roaring back But everybody lost confidence in 2001. Why? Because of some really bad peripheral investments And now we're seeing that And and I don't want to throw too many things under the busy but some things like uh robotics is very capital intensive Fusion energy is very capital intensive It's not the obvious win of AI. It's a peripheral investment Some of those will be good Some of them are going to consume a ton of money and turn into losses and that may scare off the entire investment community And so that that would be tragic because if you look at things like u just if you look at uh AI voices doing sales and customer support that's half a trillion dollars of payroll worldwide today the AI does it better than anyone on the phone already like existing teach we just need to deploy that half trillion if you invest in that you cannot go wrong but if you get sold an investment in something that's kind of like well quantum computing also might work maybe maybe it will maybe it won't but much more speculative and very very capital",
