        "text": " Good evening. India has made one of its most important AI announcements yet. Tamil Nadu has signed an MOU with Tarvam AI to build India's first full stack sovereign AI park, a 10,000 cr rupees 5-year project that could very well redefine how India builds, governs and deploys artificial intelligence at population scale. This is front page by AIM network. And as always before we deep dive into this momentous announcement please like share and subscribe. Now that you have here is the news. Chief Minister Stalin minister TRB Raja IIT Madras director Kamakoti Servam's Pratushkumar are building a dedicated sovereign AI district incorporating compute data centers foundation model labs. It is an institute for AI in governance and it is nestled within the state's trust boundary. This institution will not replicate the workings of an IT park which actually just services western clients. It actually will serve as an AIRA infrastructure zone. The data models and the computers will all be housed right here. And it is a partnership with the frontier model company under public overview making it the missing piece of the puzzle which has been found which brings us to what will it deliver for the people. The government claims 1,000 highskilled deep tech jobs but IIT Madras's director Mr. Kamakoti further expands the field and this is what he said. This will make students and researchers creators of AI, not consumers. End quote. So we are of course now in the realm of AI ready data centers reserved for government workloads, infrastructure for healthcare, agriculture, citizen services, which could lead to other states renting space on Tamil Nadu's capable foundations. Tamil Nadu is trying to be emphatic about its stance and this was echoed by TRB Raja who said Tamil Nadu will lead the nation end quote a modern digital sungum if you will is what is it being called inspired by ancient Tamilademies but instead of poets we have engineers developing Tamil first foundation models blending classical vocabulary with modern use cases. So whether AI is imported or it is culturally rooted, Tamil Nadu says it must be ours. Since you of course have been watching front page, we know you saw this coming because we tracked Saram from day one. the India AI mission selection, the 4,96 Nvidia H100 GPU allocation, the WhatsApp native Sambad agents, the partnership with Meta for wearables, and today's story is just a structural extension of the news stories we have just mentioned, resulting in a state level district, a frontier model partner and a national ambition. We of course all know that recently India's IT minister met Nvidia which means that we are looking at a pool of 50,000 plus GPUs nationally a number that did not exist a year ago. So we believe that sovereign capability becomes a reality when the sleeping giant wakes up. But of course, here is the detail the mainstream media is glossing over and front page broke this first. Mind you,",

But of course, here is the detail the mainstream media is glossing over and front page broke this first. Mind you, actually hybrid instruments. 40% grant 60% equity taken by the digital India cooperation. So when serv got that 247 cr rupees worth of GPU access, the government became a 7.6% 6% shareholder at a 1,950 K rupees valuation. Very interesting because no other country is taking equity in frontier labs as a sovereign strategy which in this case makes the state not just a regulator but also a co-founder. What then well is on the horizon? That's the question. A state's capacity is being rebuilt in real time and Tamil Nadu is the benchmark with of course the clock ticking. Server AI is expected to launch its sovereign AI model likely by the end of this month and when that happens it could be India's UPI moment for artificial intelligence and of course believe you me as always front page will bring it to you first. But before we sign off, I would like to ask you this. If you are from Tamil Nadu, how does this make you feel? Is this a big win? Please do let us know in the comments below. And always remember, think I think I am.",
