        "text": " [music] Welcome to this the inaugural episode of what's new in networking. It's a joint video between Bob Liberty from the cube research and myself. How you doing Bob? Doing great Z. Thanks for having me on. Yeah. And it's good to do a what's new in networking because it seems like there's always something new in networking every day. Yeah. and last few weeks you and I have both been on the road went to a couple of events and let's start off at the the extreme networks investor event and they had a related AI day shortly after that. at the investor event they didn't drop any [clears throat] new news but they talked a lot about their momentum right around platform one and things and so thoughts from that day. Yeah, I thought it was a it was a great day to just do a true up of all the technology announcements they had made over the course of the year earlier in the spring at their event over the summer going GA with some of the the products and then being able to provide it was held at NASDAQ right so they rang the bell that day and so forth so big day for them and an opportunity to update not only the industry analyst but the financial analyst as well on their progress yeah and and they are making good progress platform one's been announced it's in it's in the field now it seems like customer satis satisfaction with it's pretty good. I know AI is becoming a big driver. Well, not quite yet. I think there the Cisco's talked about this. They've talked about this. HP's talked about this, but about but the campus refresh coming. Correct. and we have yet to see that though, right? Yeah. I think if it's happening, it's happening pretty slowly at this point. It's expected to start accelerating as more and more organizations look to refresh their networks either from a a return to work mandate or from the front-end networks requiring to collect data for AI purposes, AI workloads. Yeah. And I know one thing you and I track the product there is that they mentioned but didn't explicitly tie to AI. Well, they kind of did, but I don't I think they could have done a little deeper job was their fabric. And their their fabric is the well, everyone's got a fabric, right? theirs is particularly unique. It runs at layer 2. they seem to have solved the scale problem with layer 2 fabrics and shortest path bridging historically had. And it seems that the you know the research we did showed that networks are getting a lot more complex. Correct. And the fabric's a good way to simplify it. And I was surprised they didn't hammer that point home a little more. Yeah. It's interesting because they do on the Wi-Fi side. They talk about we solve the world's most complex Wi-Fi",

        "text": "networks are getting a lot more complex. Correct. And the fabric's a good way to simplify it. And I was surprised they didn't hammer that point home a little more. Yeah. It's interesting because they do on the Wi-Fi side. They talk about we solve the world's most complex Wi-Fi fabric is enabling organizations to do that not only in the data center in the campus but all the way out to the branch as well. So their fabric is extensible out all that way to the branch which a lot of other organizations don't have. They'll talk about their data center and campus but not all the way to the branch. So it really I think in this upcoming refresh especially if it's to help drive AI workloads then they could have a you know real advantage there for organizations looking to simplify that networking in a in a very distributed and complex environment. Yeah. So let's see how that goes. But I would if I were them I'd really lean into that as part of their AI. And the other product they talked about and Edmord their CEO specifically called this up was Wi-Fi 7 and he predicted that you would see the adoption of Wi-Fi 7 outdo every other version of Wi-Fi which would mean though that companies would refresh ahead of normal refresh cycles. Right. So do you think the value prop of seven is good enough is strong enough that you would get companies to forward roll their their refreshes? Yeah, it's an interesting question because a lot of cases when if you remember 6E came out that was sort of the big change that was the big event that would cause someone to maybe go out of cycle to get that additional capability that additional frequency. I think with 7 now with the advent of getting approvals for outdoor that that could certainly be something that's going to accelerate that that Wi-Fi 7 transition as well. Yeah. Well, we'll see. And I actually think it is the b the bandwidths. there's more and more 60 6 GHz devices coming. I've been in facilities where they've tested it and you know with obviously this is good clean signal, but you can get north of a gig now on Wi-Fi, which you really couldn't before on any kind of 5 GZ spectrum. And and so the derivative effects of that are interesting because that would actually drive a campus refresh on the wired side because you'd have to go multi- gig. And so correct if we actually see this Wi-Fi 7 accelerate, I mean that could create a rising tide for all the vendors where they you see the the the campus network upgraded with the wireless network. Yeah. And they're obviously also trying to compete against fixed wireless access. Yeah. Right. That's coming in and trying to offer higher bandwidth and so forth through 5G and whatnot. So I think",

Yeah. Right. That's coming in and trying to offer higher bandwidth and so forth through 5G and whatnot. So I think driving organizations to look to upgrade. Certainly as more and more of the workers come back into the office that need to provide that at home experience where everyone's got a gig capabilities anywhere in the office is going to be instrumental in driving that upgrade cycle as well. Yeah. Now they did two days after that they did an investment three days they did an a more of a customer event called their AI summit and there they announced a product called extreme exchange which is a pretty interesting product. It's a kind of this generatively built canvas I suppose that uses network data to create these micro applications to do things like tell you the example they showed was in a stadium tell you how traffic flows in a stadium and how people move around and things like that. What do you think of that product? I thought it was really interesting and and the interesting piece for me was the fact that they're able to create vertical specific apps or venue specific apps that will provide value to an end user. So it's everyone's talking about where am I getting value from AI? How am I using it? And so here's a great example of based on the data that they already have, how can they take network data and translate that into business data and generate better business outcomes. So, it's still early. Still need to see it fully developed and deployed, but I think it's got a lot of potential to actually deliver better business outcomes for organizations levering leveraging the information that's coming off of the network. Yeah. Well, it it it's interesting too because I'm not sure that people fully believe that network data can be translated into business value. They've done some some proof of concepts of this in other industries like they pre-built on the Wii the extreme analytics platform. They custom built an application for the NFL. So the NFL can actually understand that when things happen in a game, they can look at the social media impact and the activity from people and make better business decisions. But outside of these one-off things, I'm not sure that business leaders would think to look at network data, but I think they're trying to make the case for Yeah. And I think that the difference what we've saw in some of those applications that they were real time. So it wasn't an analyze after the fact. it was, hey, we need to send more people to this location because it's overcrowded. We need to move this here. We need to do something there. So, I think that's the key in what",

We need to move this here. We need to do something there. So, I think that's the key in what again, especially if it's a stadium or something like that. It's all about the experience. So, how do you ensure you're able to allocate resources appropriately to ensure that the fans have the best possible experience? Yeah. Well, in we'll see how it goes next year for them. They made a pretty good case for themselves. obviously the world's getting more complex and arguably nobody solves network complexity better than Extreme does. Yeah, it's they're certainly on the right path. Yeah. Yeah. So now you went to the Meter Up event. I was I don't know where I was. I was somewhere else. but how what did you think of that event? That was their first event, right? Meet her up. It's their second year they've done this. but this one really seemed a little different. Seemed like a coming out party. They had Bob Metaf, the father of of Ethernet was there speaking. they had Satia Nadella from Microsoft was did a video session as well with everyone there during during the night too which is pretty [clears throat] right. Exactly. During night. So it was it was really star-studded cast. There were a lot of different announcements. They had nine new hardware platforms spanning their firewalls, switches and and wireless access points and gateways. they had an expansion of their AI capabilities. So they had command which helped create new widgets for organizations looking and they added that a support function to it and an operations function to that. So to help streamline the the the support functions and also the running of it on a day-to-day basis. And then the other big news is they they had signed a deal with Lumen to incorporate wireless access sorry not wireless wide area access into their portal. So for people needing to connect, they can quickly and easily do that. So three big announcements, a lot of fanfare, had a very Certino feel to it, Appleplike feel to the announcements and the sessions that were going on. And really what they're all about is, you know, they've talked about that they are by network engineers for network engineers. It's in the space of of NAS, right? Network as a service. That's how they deliver everything. But they don't spend a lot of time talking about NAS. They spend a lot of time talking about how this is architected, how it's streamlined, how it's more efficient it is. And I think what you're going to see next from them is going to be how it's delivering better business outcomes. So, let me ask you, Bob, the the story makes sense on paper, right? There's certainly room to simplify networking",

So, let me ask you, Bob, the the story makes sense on paper, right? There's certainly room to simplify networking network vendor, though? Does the world need another network vendor? Well, I mean, there's probably I'm probably tracking three or four Yeah. separate network vendors. I mean, I think it's it's a natural evolution as the larger ones consolidate. Yeah. That newer innovative ones are springing up. And when you when you hear them talk about their differentiation, it's really around a single a single stack, right? And that they own the whole stack, hardware, software across the entire portfolio. Now, part of that's because they're a smaller organization. They haven't scaled to the size, but they had some very compelling slides where they put up and they showed all the acquisitions that other networking companies had made and trying to show, hey, while there's they have all these different companies, we're one. We're one company and that allows us to ensure that we can integrate things more quickly, we can deliver value more quickly. And so right now, their their customers seem, you know, they're certainly given their stamp of approval. they continue to grow. They continue to get investment dollars to help grow the company. the interesting piece that they had talked about was the fact that all of the investment dollars they get are purely for innovation and that the company's self- sustaining. So great news from a smaller company, right? To to be able to have that ability to keep growing and then leverage the the the investment funds to really focus on innovation and drive new value. Yeah. Well, it's been because we haven't had a network startup in a while and so now we've got them. We've got Salona Highway 9. there's one other Oh, Pon's company. Yes. Nile. Nile. Right. N Shasta Cloudloud. There's a cut join. There's So there we're starting to see an influx of these other companies coming in and you know as you mentioned a bunch of those are around the private 5G area, right? So anytime there's a new technology or new space and that's the hard part about why companies acquire is because new technology arrives it's easier to buy than it is to build and so forth. I will say Meter already has a cellular piece to their Wi-Fi as well. So they've already thought that out for to a certain extent. but yeah there's a lot going on in networking as we have all said networking is cool again. Yep. Which is which is a lot of fun. , it was it was great getting Bob Metaf's take on a lot of things. Prior speech he was at, he said, \"I don't know what comes after Ethernet, but I'm pretty",

So, so on that topic, let's shift the next event. it's happening this week, HPE Discover in Barcelona. this is in some ways the coming out party for Juniper as part of HPE networking. they we got a pre- briefing on the news that dropped today as well. And interesting stuff, right? They we're seeing some evidence that Juniper and Aruba are actually coming together, I think, faster than most people would have thought. I think when the announcement happened, people said, \"Oh, it's going to take him years to integrate.\" Yeah. No, I think I think you're absolutely right. The to me some of the key takeaways was first of all, first and foremost that they're innovating together. It's been a short period since the deal closed, right? It's been about less than six months since they since they formalized it in July and what we're already seeing is their their ability to integrate. We already knew Mist was extensible that it could go across and they'd be able to do that. But the other piece was that the key news that I heard today was the fact that because both Mist and Central are AI native and built on microservices that the time to integrate those and the ability to share those across those and share those services are really going to be accelerated. And so they announced, I think it was four in total, two each, two capabilities from Mist that are going to be integrated into Central, Aruba Central, and two from Central that will be integrated into Mist. And I think what you can see here is, you know, I I like to refer to it as , you know, everyone's saying who's going to win, who's going to who's going to take over. And I think what we're going to end up seeing is that these platforms are going to become what I refer to as the principle of least astonishment. Yeah. Where they're all going to they're going to look exactly like each other, have the same capabilities, and eventually they'll just become one. Yeah. And they also announced a unified access point which to me isn't a big surprise. I mean that shouldn't be very hard to do right and for for the most part Juniper's APs were they were pretty basic. they put all their value in software where Aruba's AP I mean if you ever picked up an Aruba AP I mean this was an industrial grade like you could feel the difference right and so if they can bring some of that great",

They're keeping the two brands and I think they're doing that more for customer comfort. Correct. You know, because frankly, once you've got a unified AP, you could just call it an HPE networking. , and actually at this moment, I will say we're pre-recording this, so we don't actually know the name of it, right? So, it could just be HP networking. But, , , but then you can run it through central or mist, and frankly, all everything should eventually track to that point. And I thought that that would actually take him years to do, but and and I still think we're in the years, but it may be closer to one or two years than five or seven years. Yeah. And I think there's also precedent. We've seen this before where companies have acquired lots of different companies and put it on a path to a universal hardware. So it's not without precedence that they have a roadmap for how they want to do this and what's the best way to do it. So I'm looking forward to seeing that continue to become integrated. the technology, the software u and eventually the the platforms themselves. They did mention it was interesting they did call out the fact that Mist was more for cloud-based and that the Ruba central was was more for the hybrid or on premises as well. That's that's reality of itself, right? So, especially for sovereign clouds, things like that, right? Where that's going to be an issue, data sovereignty and so forth. They they do have options and in the government, right? In fact, in fact, most of Ruba central sales were on prem. I know they've had a cloud offering of late, but I don't think they were tremendously successful with that. So, now they do offer a couple new hardware platforms. I want to make sure I get this right. It's the new MX301 multi-ervice edge router that's built on the Juniper silicon. Y and then the new HP QFX switch with the 5250 built on Broadcom. that's the Tom Hawk 6 chip. it's the first OEM with Tom Hawk 6 liquid cooled. They're both 1.6 TBTE. the QFX is built for Nvidia. so to be optimized for that and so there's a couple good hardware platforms there so you know we talk a lot about",

I texted you when we were told that and I said, \"Is it really?\" And because but no one's ever told me there's this before and I Googled it and I I think it actually is. So yeah. So yeah. So again, it's great. I think that that really again the bigger story, the underlying story is that pace of innovation which is great to see coming out of that combined entity. Yeah. And they also came out with this this is part of their scale across. So correct you know they like everyone else now can scale up scale across. They announced an u an Nvidia partnership as well. which is important I guess you got to have Nvidia and a lab I think they announced in in Europe especially so I think that'll be super helpful one of the other more interesting ones I thought was the AMD announcement yeah because that was actually a lot of the network vendors will talk about scale out and scale across they actually have Ethernet for scale up in in an AMD cabinet so that was really interesting again to see how Juniper was leveraging some of the already existing relationship ship that HPE had on the on the compute side and the storage side and things of that to be able to drive their networking solutions. Yeah, you know, I'm fascinated to see too if how big this motor around Nvidia is. On the last journey's call, Jensen talked a lot about the software driving the value, which is true. It's CUDA and I know everyone nobody wants a single dominant vent except maybe Nvidia I suppose but but it's good for the industry to have competitors but you know certainly AMD is a formidable competitor but they are way behind as far as volume goes compared to Nvidia so correct correct yeah so hopefully maybe this is the start we'll see we'll see what this del so news from extreme meter h juniper aruba anybody else want thought.
