First, it was the flips, then the martial arts routines, then that ridiculous [music] sprint demo where the robot moved like it wanted to enter a 100 meter race. But this time, this one hits different. Because for the first time, the G1 isn't just moving its own body. It's interacting with something completely unpredictable. A basketball, a simple everyday object that suddenly turns into a physics nightmare when you try to control it. It rolls, it spins, it rebounds at weird angles. So, when a humanoid robot steps onto a court and starts taking real shots, that's not just an update. That's a massive leap. Hey guys, Alfie here. Welcome back to AI Nexus. Let me show you why this basketball moment is actually a huge breakthrough for the G1. Up until now, the G1's world was clean and controlled. Every demo had one variable, the robot itself. Balance, speed, coordination, all inside its own system. But the moment you introduce a bouncing basketball, everything becomes chaotic. Now the robot has to predict motion, control pressure, stabilize its body, and time its release. All while tracking a moving object in real time. And somehow it works. We've all seen the G1 do wild things before, but basketball forces the robot to learn a completely new skill set. It has to grip the ball without crushing it. It has to aim based on the hoop's exact location, not just an estimate. It has to calculate [music] gravity, distance, and release timing in one smooth motion. And while doing that, it's constantly adjusting its stance based on what the cameras see frame by frame. Here's what makes this so insane. All of this is happening at the exact same moment. No pauses, no hesitation, no processing moment. just a continuous stream of vision, motion planning, torque control, and balance working together at full speed. But the detail that shocked everyone is this. The G1 isn't just taking random shots. It's mimicking actual NBA signature moves, LeBron's single leg silencer pose, Kobe's fadeaway jumper with the backward lean, mid-range footwork that takes humans years to master. These moves require rock solid balance on one foot, perfect upper body and lower body timing, a controlled release angle, and extremely fast reaction to micro adjustments. Humans build this through muscle memory. The G1 learned it with data and did it in months. Let me know in the comments. Is this real progress for humanoids or just a flashy demo to go viral? Now, let's talk about how the G1 actually learns this stuff, because this is the part most people missed. Unitry is using a new system called ASAP, a framework that teaches the robot sports skills by aligning simulation with real world physics. It looks simple on paper, but it's incredibly powerful. Stage one, training in simulation.",

        "text": "G1 actually learns this stuff, because this is the part most people missed. Unitry is using a new system called ASAP, a framework that teaches the robot sports skills by aligning simulation with real world physics. It looks simple on paper, but it's incredibly powerful. Stage one, training in simulation. basketball movements from human players. jump timing, foot placement, body rotation, shot release angles. Then they convert all that motion into a data format the robot can understand. Inside simulation, the G1 can practice thousands of attempts without breaking hardware. It can fail fast, correct its posture, test different release timings, try different grip pressures. Every successful shot and every bad shot becomes part of the G1's training library. Stage two, training in the real world. Once the robot understands the theory, it tries the moves in real physical space. And at first, it fails constantly. Too much force on the ball, not enough rotation, incorrect weight shift, leaning too far back, releasing too early. But every failure creates new data. Data that tells the system where the simulation and the real world don't match. Slowly, those two worlds begin to align. And with each iteration, the G1 gets smoother, faster, and more accurate. One of the hardest challenges is the grip. The robot's hands have to automatically adjust how tightly they hold the ball. Too much pressure and the ball warps or slips. Too little and the ball shoots out of its hands like a rocket. So, the G1 is making tiny corrections the entire time, tightening, loosening, stabilizing, all in sync with the rest of the shot mechanics. Now, let's break down the five phases of a proper basketball shot because this will show you how advanced the G1 actually is. Knee bend for power. Upward extension for lift. Torso rotation for shot alignment. Arm extension for aim. Wrist flick for accuracy. If even one of these phases happens too early or too late, the shot is ruined. Humans sync these phases automatically using muscle memory. Robots don't have that. They have to calculate every millisecond. And even while calculating all of this, the G1 must stay balanced. When you shoot a basketball, your center of mass shifts in multiple directions, forward, upward, sideways. Humans adjust instantly. Robots can't feel balance. They measure and react. [music] So, the G1 constantly senses every shift in its body and corrects its stance instantly. Watching the robot hold a fadeaway pose without wobbling is honestly surreal. If you had the chance, would you play basketball with a Unitry G1 or would you be scared it might dunk on you? Because I swear I might walk off the court if it hits me with a step back three.

This basketball update wasn't even Unit's biggest announcement this month. A small startup from China showed something that felt impossible. A robot moving through behavior. No puppeteers, [music] no tricks, and Google are secretly building the AI brain that could run on every robot on the planet. Let's start with Mindon because what they've shown recently is turning heads everywhere. This six-month-old Chinese startup out of Shenzen just showcased a humanoid robot doing household chores with the fluidity that feels eerily human. We're talking about a robot vacuuming on its knees, standing up to open curtains with a gentle tug, [music] climbing onto a stool to water plants on high shelves, carrying packages balanced on one arm, wiping kitchen counters in circular motions, picking up toys from under tables, handing over fruit baskets. The movements aren't jerky or robotic. They're smooth, purposeful, careful. And here's the crazy part. They explicitly claim the robot isn't teleyoperated, and nothing is sped up. No hidden puppeteer, no fastforward tricks, no behind-the-scenes control system, just autonomous AI doing real tasks in real time. If this is legit, we're watching a massive leap in what's [music] called loco manipulation, where robots move and manipulate objects simultaneously in unstructured environments like your actual messy home. Now, here's where it gets interesting. The hardware. Instead of following the traditional approach taken by companies like Tesla or Figure, building the entire robot body and software stack from scratch, Mindon chose a different path. Mindon didn't build their own robot from scratch. They took the Unit G1, a popular Chinese humanoid platform that costs around $16,000. Compare that to $100,000 competitors, and you see why developers love it. The G1 has quietly become one of the most attractive platforms for AI researchers. Affordable, rugged, packed with sensors, and flexible enough for everything from locomotion research to manipulation benchmarks. It's basically the developer favorite for experimenting with cuttingedge robot intelligence. The G1 stands about 4T 3, has 23 to 43 joints depending on configuration, and comes packed with 3D liar, depth cameras, and force sensors. Out of the box, it's basically a blank slate. [music] Great for kung fu demos, but needs serious software to handle real tasks. Mindon modified it with custom grippers for those dextrous hands and plugged in their proprietary AI brain. Suddenly, this affordable platform becomes a chorem, handling tasks across diverse scenarios with claimed 80% success in unfamiliar environments. That's the industry benchmark for embodied AI that can actually generalize. But the real magic is the tech under the hood. Mindon's whole goal is to build the AI brain, the intelligence layer that can run on any compatible robot body. Quick question for you. Do you think Mindon's robot is truly autonomous or is there something we're not seeing? Comment real or fake? I'm curious what you think.",

Do you think Mindon's robot is truly autonomous or is there something we're not seeing? Comment real or fake? I'm curious what you think. powerful techniques. First, reinforcement learning where the robot essentially practices tasks millions of times in simulation. [music] Learning from trial and error like a human learning through repetition. Every failure teaches it something gradually optimizing its behavior. Second, imitation learning where the AI studies human demonstrations and learns to copy those motions building a library of useful behaviors from watching how people naturally move and manipulate objects. Third, and this is crucial sim to real transfer, the bridge between virtual training and physical deployment. You can't just train in simulation and expect it to work perfectly in reality because the real world has friction, lighting variations, unexpected obstacles, and a million tiny details that simulations miss. Mind on fine-tunes their models to handle that gap, adapting virtual learning to messy reality. The result is what we see in the demo. Whole body task fluidity that's genuinely rare in robotics. The G1 bends under tables without losing balance, climbs onto stools without tipping, interacts with moving children without collision, all while maintaining smooth, coordinated motion. Mindon's AI is specifically optimized for contactrich tasks like pushing, wiping, and manipulating. [music] Solving what researchers call the data bottleneck by generating massive training [music] data sets in simulation. Here's the crazy part, though. Mindon is only 6 months old. They're not swimming in billions of venture capital like some competitors. Their mission is laser focused. Create an AI brain, not another expensive hardware platform. Think of them as the Android of humanoid robotics, providing the smarts that run on existing bodies. Rather than building everything from scratch, they spun out of Tencent ecosystem, part of China's booming humanoid scene where hardware is cheap and plentiful. Their approach is modular. sell or license the brain as a service. Imagine upgrading your basic robot with mind on AI via an app update. That's the vision. If they nail generalization at scale, affordable platforms like the G1 become genuinely viable for homes, [music] undercutting pricier integrated bots from Western giants. This software over hardware model could genuinely democratize robotics, making advanced capabilities accessible without the $100,000 price tag. Make sure to subscribe because every week the AI world drops something insane [music] and we break it down first. And Mindon isn't alone in this race to build the universal robot brain. Enter Skilled AI, the Pittsburgh startup that's making everyone's jaw drop with their so-called immortal robot controller founded by Carnegie Melon professors.

Their skilled brain is genuinely omni. one AI model that controls radically different robot bodies. They've demonstrated a quadriped robot getting its legs literally chainsawed off and it immediately reorganizes its gate and lifted a four-legged bot onto its hind legs and the AI just treated it like a humanoid and walked it around. Motors disabled, wheels jammed, legs tied together, limbs lengthened. The controller adapts on the fly. Zero shot, no code changes mid demo. This is online adaptation in its purest form. The same pre-trained policy changes behavior in real time when the body or environment shifts without pausing for fine-tuning. Real talk. If a robot can lose a leg mid task and still keep going, does that scare you or impress you? Comment scared or impressed? How is this possible? skilled trained their AI across roughly 100,000 simulated robot bodies, exposing it to countless shapes, joint layouts, and failure scenarios. Their transformer model, Loco former remembers [music] long histories of sensor data and actions. So when something changes, like losing a leg or gaining height, it infers the new dynamics and adjusts instantly. Instead of memorizing movements for one robot, it learns the general principles of balance and motion, letting it adapt to almost anything with no extra training. But wait, there's more. Google Deep Mind just entered the arena with serious firepower. Google is pushing hard toward the same idea, building the AI brain first, and their newest reveal, Simma 2, is another major step in that direction. And Google recently introduced Gemini Robotics 1.5 AI models that let robots reason stepby step, plan tasks, use digital tools, and generalize across different robot bodies. The demos show robots sorting fruits by color, separating clothes, following city recycling rules, and even checking whether to pack bags. Two models handle this. Gemini Robotics , the planner that understands scenes and creates step-by-step actions, and Gemini Robotics, which converts those plans into precise movements. The key breakthrough is that these robots now think before acting, generating natural language reasoning, so their decisions are understandable and far more capable. Google's Sema 2 is Deep Mind's next step toward real world robotics. an AI trained in openw world games to follow natural instructions, even vague ones, and achieve about 60% success on unseen tasks. It learns from gameplay across multiple titles using a self-improving loop, letting skills like mining or navigation transfer between worlds. Games act as infinite training grounds for embodied AI. And with tools like Genie, Deep Mind can generate endless environments. These virtual skills can move to real robots through sim to real methods. The goal is [music] clear.

We're talking about the chat GPT moment for embodied AI, where robots finally learn and adapt like large language models due China's edge and mass-produced cheap hardware combined with AI talent could accelerate this faster than anyone [music] expected. But the US still leads in sophisticated AI architectures and reasoning systems. This isn't just about cool demos anymore. This is about who builds the Android operating system for the physical world. And based on what we're seeing in late 2025, that future is arriving way faster than anyone predicted. Remember that viral female robot Xpang revealed the one that walked so perfectly people thought it was a human in a suit? Well, Xpang just announced that the iron platform behind it is now heading into mass production. And before you think this is a small update, even Elon Musk reacted to the Iron demo, saying, \"Not bad. Tesla and Chinese companies will dominate this space. Everyone else in the west is weak. If Musk is impressed, you know something big is happening. Xpang just revealed something nobody expected this early and it changes everything. And behind this reveal, Xpang made their boldest statement yet. Mass production from vision to reality. Just a straightup confirmation that iron is entering the manufacturing phase. This isn't a lab experiment anymore. Xpang is gearing up to build humanoids at scale. But here's the part that really shocked everyone. Xpang didn't say whether these robots in formation were the male iron or the female iron. They keep calling it the iron platform. And they're technically right. The internals are the same. The body styling, the outer design, the appearance, those are all just skins. But let's be honest, the world isn't obsessed with the male iron. It's the female iron that broke the internet. The one that walked across the stage so naturally that millions of people refuse to believe it was a robot. And if X Pang is mass-producing the Iron platform, guess what that means? That smooth, eerie, almost human female version could end up being the mainstream face of Iron. And that is wild to think about. But here's where the story gets even crazier.

They said 2026 is the year they start preparing the true manufacturing pipeline. And by the end of 2026, they batches, not test units, large-scale production. That's the kind of language companies use when they're preparing to ship thousands. And this means one thing for you and me. Humanoids aren't sci-fi anymore. They're becoming a product. If you had the chance, would you buy an iron robot in 2026? Yes or no? And why? Drop your thoughts below. I always check the comments. And some of your ideas are better than what the AI labs are doing. Now, let's slow down for a second and talk about why this update is such a big deal. Because it's not only about the number of robots. It's about the female iron itself. The reason the world can't stop talking about it is simple. It doesn't move like a robot. It moves like a person. Before all this mass production talk, Xping showed off a female version of Iron at their AI day in Guanghou, and people were absolutely freaked out. This robot walked onto the stage with a clearly feminine shape. Slimmer waist, softer lines, modelike posture, and when it started walking, it didn't move like a typical stiff humanoid. It glided across that stage with slow, deliberate hip and shoulder movement. The arms swung naturally. It had this catwalk style gate that made everyone's jaw drop. The audience started whispering and social media exploded with the same question. Is this really a robot or did X Ping just put an actual woman in a robot suit? Multiple reports say people in the crowd were convinced it had to be a human performer because the walk looked way too natural. So, what did X Punk do? the CEO. His Saopong brought the robot back on stage and literally cut into [music] it right there in front of everyone. He [snorts] peeled back the soft white outer layer, what some articles call synthetic flesh, and exposed the internal frame, metal rods, servos, artificial muscle structures, the whole mechanical skeleton. And get this, he actually apologized to the robot while doing it. He said he hoped this would be the last time iron needed to prove it is itself. That's both hilarious and kind of haunting at the same time, but it worked. Robotics analysts confirmed Iron really does use a human-like spine and leg architecture. There's this bionic fascia layer between the frame and the skin that helps smooth out motion so it feels organic. The female walk wasn't acting or tricks. It's real mechanical engineering in the hips, knees, and ankles, giving the robot that human gate. Pang has openly said iron will come in different body types and gender with customizable appearance and clothing. They want it to feel like a",

Pang has openly said iron will come in different body types and gender with customizable appearance and clothing. They want it to feel like a cold machine. That's why they went hard on making the female version look and move so realistically. They're testing how people react to gender presentation in robots. And based on the internet response, mission accomplished. People are shocked, fascinated, and a little creeped out all at once. If you want real AI news without the fluff, make sure you're subscribed. We're just getting started. But Xping didn't stop at appearance. They wanted to prove the body wasn't just for show. It could move. They released footage of an iron robot doing martial arts moves. And I'm not talking about jerky robotic karate chops. This thing drops into a proper martial arts stance with knees bent, feet planted wide, upper body relaxed and centered. Then it moves through this slow, controlled sequence, arms sweeping in smooth arcs, wrists rotating into careful poses, fingers extending and curling with precision. The weight shifts from one leg to the other without any stumble or stutter. Xping captioned it, \"The robot kung fu master with lines like, \"In every move, there's balance. In every pause, there's power. Even robots can master the art of inner peace.\" Some people think it looks more like Tai Chi than hard kung fu because of how slow and meditative it is. But that's the point. The transitions are completely continuous, not stop motion animation. Why does this matter? Because under the hood, Iron has 82 degrees of freedom. across its entire body. That means the spine, shoulders, hips, knees, [music] ankles, wrists, and fingers can all coordinate together instead of moving like separate chunks. Each hand alone has 22\u00b0 of freedom for those delicate finger movements. And it's powered by three Touring AI chips pushing 2250 trillion operations per second. That's the compute power generating and controlling those motions in real time. Xping isn't just making a robot that can walk from point A to point B. They're choreographing the whole body to move like a living thing. But X Pang didn't stop at showing off that kung fu flow. They wanted everyone to see the hardware wasn't just flexible. It could pull off movements with surgical precision. Two female iron robots walking side by side in perfect sync. And I mean perfect. Their movements are mirrored so flawlessly it creates this optical illusion like one is reflecting the other. But plot twist, there's no mirror. Both robots are real and they're sinking up in real time. The gate is inspired by fashion models on a catwalk.
