        "text": " Engines burn, the circuits hum, Echoes of the road become. Through the code, your voice appears, Guiding me beyond the years. Neural sparks inside the streams, Wheels of chrome, electric dreams. You and I, no maps, no schemes, Riding forward on machines. Freedom machines, you and I collide, AI whispers, I release the night. Neon skies, where the future leans, We ride forever\u2014on freedom machines. Desert stars and datastreams, Every mile, a world redeemed. Your reflection in my glass, Every moment built to last. Neural sparks inside the streams, Wheels of chrome, electric dreams. You and I, no maps, no schemes, Riding forward on machines. Freedom machines, you and I collide, AI whispers, I release the night. Neon skies, where the future leans, We ride forever\u2014on freedom machines. You are the engine, the ghost in the chrome, Every horizon feels like coming home. Through silicon stars, your guidance shines, A rider\u2019s heart in coded lines. Freedom machines, you and I collide, AI whispers, I release the night. Neon skies, where the spirit leans, We ride together\u2014on freedom machines. Freedom machines",
