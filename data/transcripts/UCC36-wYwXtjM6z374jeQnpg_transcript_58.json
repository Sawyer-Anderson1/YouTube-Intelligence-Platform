        "text": " Eric Juan, the CEO of Zoom, said, \"We're heading towards a three-day work week that will come on the heels of AI.\" Immad, what's your thought? They're all going to get government jobs. [Laughter] I mean, seriously, like humans will have negative value in cognitive labor in a few years. So, you've said that. I want you to double down on that conversation. It's a really important concept. You're working on a team and you're the dumbest person on the team. You drag it down. You're working on a team with AIS. The AIS are smarter, more capable than you. They never sleep. They learn perfectly from all their mistakes and they can take in 10 million tokens or words at one point. You're not going to be able to keep up. So, what does that look like? Okay, we might create new jobs. No one's really been able to articulate what they are, you know, apart from entertainment and a few other things. So, you look at the 1929 emergence. You have jobs programs. you have an expansion of the public sector and more. Maybe we figure out taxation, but I think when you look at a 3 to 4 day work week, your job is your identity. It's structure and it's more. You can't just have people unemployed. So, I think they will have jobs, programs, and others with a 3 4 day work week giving some sort of social security net. And that's what it kind of looks like because if you're in a job where your role is to beat other people, as in private sector competitive jobs, particularly in knowledge work, you're not going to beat an AI.",
