        "text": " Modeling and simulation are core pillars of science and engineering workflows. AI surrogate models can enable nearrealtime simulation workflows. To develop such models, it's critical to integrate domain knowledge. But building these knowledge guided models isn't easy. Training a model only on available data restricts its usability as it has very limited generalizability. Existing frameworks also don't cater to approaches that fuse data with domain knowledge. NVIDIA Physics Nemo is an open-source AI physics platform for developing AI surrogates. It provides a framework for fusing data and domain knowledge and offers an easytouse, optimized, and scalable pipeline for training AI physics models. NVIDIA Physics Nemo repository enables AI physics researchers to share and collaborate their work with experts in all computational sciences and engineering domains. It makes AI more accessible for engineers and scientists with reference applications and supporting models. With NVIDIA physics Nemo, simulation solution providers can develop AI augmented workflows across industries to address complex multifysics problems. Here are a few industry case studies. Seamans GESA used physics Nemo to train an AI surrogate to optimize wind farm design. The super resolution model emulates the large eddy flow of a turbine wake 4,000 times faster than simulation. Researchers can train generative AI models like core diff for AI based weather forecasting. And by training an AI surrogate model in physics Nemo to emulate blood flow, medical researchers can use insidue simulations for better, more personalized treatment.",
