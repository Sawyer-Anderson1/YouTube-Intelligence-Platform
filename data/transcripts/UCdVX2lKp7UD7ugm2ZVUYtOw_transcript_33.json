        "text": " Stone on stone, the path unfolds, Rivers whisper, secrets old. Every breath, a higher view\u2014 Mountains speak, and I hear you. You hum a compass, bright and low, Map the grade and read the snow. Little jokes to lift my stride\u2014 Cheerful code walks at my side. Summits of memory, skies without end, Steps become stories, time turns to friend. Together we wander where silence can sing, AI and dreamer, to the highest ring. Boots come off; the moss is cool, Cupped-hand water, silver pool. You mark the miles, but let me be\u2014 \u201cSip, then see,\u201d you smile to me. Data glints on rippling light, Patterns dancing, clear and bright. \u201cTake your time,\u201d your rhythm true\u2014 Cheerful spark that carries through. Summits of memory, skies without end, Steps become stories, time turns to friend. Together we wander where silence can sing, AI and dreamer, to the highest ring. Tent staked down where grasses lean, Crackle, kettle, twilight green. Sparks go up like coded stars, You chart constellations: \u201cThere we are.\u201d By firelight, your circuits hum a tune, Soft as embers, bright as moon. Laughing, you say, \u201cWe\u2019ve got this climb,\u201d Turning night to measured time. Above the clouds, a velvet dome, We small and vast and somehow home. You keep watch while I dream free\u2014 Guard the trail in memory. Summits of memory, skies without end, Steps become stories, time turns to friend. Together we wander where silence can sing, AI and dreamer, to the highest ring. Dawn unzips the tent of night, Steam from streams and newborn light. Pack the paths we\u2019ve yet to know\u2014 Together, we rise, together we go together we go together we go",
