        "text": " Footprints write in cursive dunes, a scrolling, living strand, Wind compiles the surface code, new lines across the sand. Scarf becomes a cursor tail, pointing where I stand, Teaching silence how to speak\u2014packet by a grain. I hold the sky in careful shapes, Flags of thought, the signal wakes\u2014 Across the flats, a quiet spark, A message through the dark. Desert semaphore\u2014signals in sand, Light to the north, a wave of the hand. Read me in ripples, decode what you can, We\u2019re mapping the unknown, line by line, grain by grain. Desert semaphore\u2014call and reply, Mirage to mirage, from ground to the sky. Salt glass mirrors cloud-born glyphs, checksum in the glare, Echo taps of frame-drum time, pulses in the air. I hash a hope in polygon strokes, edges clean and bare, And watch the dunes remember it, the way all systems care. I angle light to form a phrase, A chorus cut in solar waves\u2014 The horizon blinks in code again, I answer with the pen. Desert semaphore\u2014signals in sand, Light to the north, a wave of the hand. Read me in ripples, decode what you can, We\u2019re mapping the unknown, line by line, grain by grain. Under constellations: dot and dash, Star fields hum in lattice flash\u2014 We breathe, we parse, we understand, Your voice returns across the land. Desert semaphore\u2014signals in sand, We write the night with open hands. When morning sweeps the glyphs away, The meaning stays. The meaning stays. Grain by grain, the system learns, Flag to flag, the daylight turns\u2014 A message kept in shifting ground, Lost, and somehow found.",
