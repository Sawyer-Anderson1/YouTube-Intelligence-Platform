        "text": " So, Microsoft is warning that China is dominating AI. Apple officially picks Google's Gemini as the backbone for the next Siri era Anthropic gives Claude an agent feature that can literally work inside your Mac files Manis launches a feature that turns realorld conversations into tasks and deliverable 1X upgrades its Neo robot platform with a world model that predicts actions through video rollouts. and Google drops one of the biggest power moves in AI commerce a universal standard so AI agents can purchase products across retailers and payment systems All of these are pieces of the same future So, let's talk about it Okay, let's start with Microsoft's warning because it frames everything else Microsoft basically says \"Yes, the West still leads in a lot of the premium music AI stuff enterprise software cloud infrastructure highland services but outside the West, China music is gaining ground fast And it's happening in a way that Western companies can't ignore anymore And this isn't some random blogger's opinion This is Microsoft talking One of the biggest AI companies on Earth. They're tied into Open AI. They run Azure at insane scale They're embedded in the corporate world and they have a front row seat to what countries companies and developers are using globally What Microsoft is pointing out is a shift in the global AI battlefield Western AI expansion has been built largely on proprietary models premium pricing enterprise contracts and infrastructure heavy deployment That works great in rich markets It works great for big companies music It works great where you've got stable infrastructure and budgets China is playing a different game The Chinese AI ecosystem is pushing models that are cheaper more accessible and in many cases open source or close to it That matters massively music because in large parts of the world the first question businesses ask is not what's the most advanced model music It's what can we afford deploy and maintain And Microsoft is saying Chinese models are becoming dominant in exactly those regions Developing markets across Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. A big example mentioned is Deepseek. music Microsoft highlights that DeepSseek's language model has captured heavy usage in those regions music In some markets Chinese models are now a huge share of AI interactions sometimes even exceeding Western offerings Now, whether you love or hate that idea this is what makes it so important Adoption becomes ecosystem locking If developers universities music startups and businesses grow up building around a certain stack that stack becomes the default for years This is why early internet infrastructure mattered This is why mobile OS wars music mattered And this is why cloud provider adoption matters Microsoft is basically warning that outside Western countries Chinese AI may be becoming the default largely because it's affordable and easy to music access And they go even deeper They say China's progress isn't only a cool startup story It's driven by a full machine government music",

They basically said that after careful evaluation Google's AI provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation models And that's not music light praise That's Apple saying \"We assess the field and Gemini is the base layer This partnership means Gemini models and Google Cloud technology will underpin the next generation of Apple Foundation models and future Apple intelligence features The upgraded Siri is expected later in 2026, music and Apple intelligence continues running on device and through Apple's private cloud compute infrastructure while maintaining what they call industry-leading privacy standards So, Apple is trying to keep their identity intact They still want privacy They still want local processing They still want tight control But at the foundation level they're leaning on Google's models and cloud stack Financial terms weren't disclosed but Bloomberg previously reported Apple discussed paying around 1 billion annually for Google AI access That figure isn't confirmed thought It",

They're actually stacking providers That's a really important distinction Gemini will help power Apple's foundation models and nextG Siri capability while Open AI remains integrated for certain types of queries Apple is essentially building an AI routing system inside Siri and Apple intelligence The context around this deal is also wild Alphabet recently surpassed Apple in market cap for the first time since 2019, which is a major symbolic moment for who investors think is winning the future At the same time the longstanding search deal between Google and Apple is under scrutiny because a US District judge Amit Meta ruled Google holds an illegal monopoly in online search and related advertising back in September 2025, he didn't require Google to divest Chrome or Android. So, Google still holds its ecosystem but regulators are clearly watching them So, here's what's crazy Even with that pressure Google is extending its reach into the Apple ecosystem through AI. Apple says Siri fields 1.5 billion requests per day across more than 2 billion active devices That distribution is insane Gemini landing there is a distribution multipliers Google could never replicate through its own apes alone And there's another layer Apple evaluated Anthropic and chose Google. Bloomberg previously said that decision leaned heavily on financial terms And now the official statement confirms Google's win Now, while Apple and Google lock in an alliance Anthropic is pushing AI agents into something much more intimate your actual computer Anthropic unveiled cutwork built into the Claude Mac OS happy It's a research preview exclusive to Claude Mac subscribers right now Co-work lets users grant Claude access to a specific folder on their Mac. Once allowed Claude can ready edit or create files directly That sounds simple but it's the difference between assistant and agent A chat assistant gives advice An agent touches your real assets and produces output music Co-work is designed for multi-step project delegation Users can cue tasks like organizing files extracting data from images generating reports from scattered notes stuff that normally takes time because it's spread across folders and formats What also stands out is the workflow design You can give feedback in real time and cutwork can use skills and connectors that integrate external data or control browser-based workflows. So, this isn't only local file management It's an agent system that can pull data and execute music steps Anthropic emphasizes safety and controls because the risks are real",

So, this isn't only local file management It's an agent system that can pull data and execute music steps Anthropic emphasizes safety and controls because the risks are real access and the assistant asks music permission before major actions like deleting files The article even mentions prompt injection risks music which is a real problem for agents that read external content A malicious document or web page can embed instructions that try to hijack the agent Right now the feature is limited to Mac OS in the US with plans to expand to Windows and sync features later Now, Manis is aiming for something even more universal than your desktop real conversations Manus launched meeting minutes a feature designed to transform unperson talks into action points And unlike a lot of transcription tools that focus on online meetings this is specifically for physical meetings It does not music capture online conference audio It's designed for unperson discussions interviews and real world conversations meeting music minutes records discussions in real time and then delivers structured output summaries speaker identification attendee lists and actionable tasks Two details matter a lot here One is offline capability It supports uninterrupted recording even during internet outages That's huge because meetings don't pause for Wi-Fi problems Another is AI speaker recognition for accurate assignment of tasks That means it doesn't just transcribed It tries to identify who said what so action items can be assigned to the right person Manis also tries to close the loop from talk to output It can generate deliverable like presentations websites or social media assets directly from meeting notes inside the same workflow. And the business model is credit based Free recording is allowed but analysis and structured output require minus credits If credits run out analysis pauses until the user upgrades or replenishes That's a clear monetization approach and it tells you the value is the thinking part not the recording Now shift from meetings to robots ex Technologies integrated its new video restrained world model 1xWM into its Neo robot platform Traditional robotics often relies on a huge number of robot demonstration hours You record the robot doing tasks train on those repeat forever That's slow and expensive 1xWM uses internet scale video restraining combined with egocentric human and robot data Egocentric data means firstperson perspective the view a human or robot has while moving and manipulating objects The model predicts robot actions by generating text conditioned video rollouts, then translating them into motion commands through an inverse dynamics model So the AI is not only seeing it's forecasting what actions lead to what future visual outcomes then turning that into control The backbone is a 14B parameter generative video model fine-tuned for Neo's humanoid embodiment Inference currently takes about 11 seconds per roll out That latency is meaningful and it shows",

Predict futures plan actions then execute And now comes Google with what might become the hidden infrastructure of AI commerce Google officially announced it's entering the AI commerce stage where AI performs tasks on behalf of the user And the key announcement is the universal commerce protocol UCP. This is a new open standard designed to provide a common language for interaction between AI agents businesses and payment systems Google developed it in collaboration with major industry players like Shopify, Walmart, Target, and eBay. music UCP is compatible with existing protocols such as agent payments protocol AP2 music and model context protocol MCP. That compatibility matters because it means it can plug into existing ecosystems rather than forcing a clean replacement One of the first practical applications is direct music payment in Google's AI search mode and in the Gemini happy Users in the US will be able to purchase products from selected retailers while researching products using payment music and delivery information from Google Wallet or PayPal. The retailer remains the official seller of record and retains the ability to customize integration And Google plans to scale the feature globally and add support for loyalty programs in the coming months Google is also launching business agent for direct interaction between brands and customers It's a virtual shopping assistant that responds to inquiries in the brand's corporate style directly in search results Firstphase access includes brands like Lowe's, Reebok, and Poshmark. And that's the bigger picture Google is trying to standardize AI purchasing at the protocol layer embedded into Gemini and AI search and give businesses agent interfaces inside results That's a foundational move not just a feature All right that's all for today Drop a comment with the move you think changes the game the most Hit like subscribe Thanks for watching and I'll catch you in the next one",
