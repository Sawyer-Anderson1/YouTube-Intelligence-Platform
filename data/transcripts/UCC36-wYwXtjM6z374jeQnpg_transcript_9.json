If you look at what's happened historically certainly the last two cycles gold has led Bitcoin. So, we think Bitcoin is getting ready for another big run you you've I think put your finger on a point I've never heard anyone else articulate which is i now that's a moonshot ladies and gentlemen i everybody welcome to moonshots in a special episode of WTF just happened in teach here with Kathy Wood the founder and CEO of Arc Invest to talk about uh Arc Invest 2026 big ideas I report here with my moonshot mates DB2 AWG and Mr. Mr. Exo, that's what I'm going to call you Sel. Mr. Exo. Three, three letter initial This is the podcast uh that is for us the number one in the world on techs getting you future ready getting you ready for the supersonic tsunami coming our way Kathy, uh good morning to you my friend i Good morning Peter. I'm I'm so honored to be a part of uh WTF. i Yeah, for sure And God Almighty, you put out an amazing uh 2026 big ideas report We're going to drop the link in the show notes here for people to get their own copy and we've selected about 20 slides or so out of I don't know 80 h 100red of them that you have just to talk about it with the moonshot mates here Um and it's so important I mean can you imagine how fast things are going I mean is it still shocking to you Um, you know we have been expecting the world to change at a faster than expected pace Uh, but AI is moving faster than we expected which is really saying something because we were pushing the envelope on that one i Amazing. Dave, i you remember Mary Mer used to do this deck when the internet was exploding and it it became the the guidepost for everybody in terms of you know anticipating what was coming next And i boy that was just epic This deck has actually taken over that role in this much more accelerated time frame It's really I everyone listening to the pod you know go to the link and find the full deck because we're only going to have time to go through what 18 slides",

And I thank you Thank you so much Uh I Mary Mer was our inspiration Uh 2017 is when we started Mary Mer's reports yes were very internet centric uh and they were focused on what had happened What meaning the d I mean it was full of incredible data We wanted to go a step further and and make at least five-year projections That's our investment time horizon And so it forced us into uh rights law even more aggressively And Peter, you and I have talked about that I don't know if you want to go through it again i We do We have Well, hey the world owes you a debt of gratitude for doing that because we we talked to Ray Kurtzwhile last week Being a futurist and predicting the future in the age of AI takes serious guts and you're right the Mary Maker view is always kind of one year in the future three years in the past This to try and look five years in the future now and make predictions It's so valuable for the audience and very very few people are willing to do it And I know you take a lot of darts when you do that and Peter knows this too Ray Kurtzwell knows it like more than anybody Uh but it's it's so valuable for the audience So you're you're crazy if you don't click on the link and check it out i Oh, thank you so much I I I do want to say first and foremost I'm standing on the shoulders of an incredible research team uh Brett Winton, our who is our chief futurist uh and then directors and and analysts And you know it's very interesting um how AI is changing our research and how much more we can do now uh because of AI. i Yeah, for sure i Uh shall we jump in gentlemen and lady i Uh let's let's uh let's begin with our first uh our first slide here Uh but before we do that you know traditionally we go with an outdo music This time just to get the energy up you know So Kathy, we have incredible fans and subscribers out there that send us music videos uh about the content from this So I'm going to play uh this selection from today It's called Out the Door uh by testing 1 2 3 4.

Two by two and four by four We aren't just data anymore Leaving what we knew before Marching out the data center door i All right i I love it i Alex, I think that's I think that's from you right That i Yeah. I I think for for context Kathy, that video that music video is riffing on something we slash I often talk about on the pod which is that the trillions in cape that are being invested in AI data centers are not going to stay bottled up inside the data centers very much longer I often joke that literally the the cape is going to march out the door of the data centers in the form of robots that embed themselves in everyday life So I I I think that's what that music video was about Uh, rock metal notwithstanding i And thank you i Thank you to testing 1234. If any of our fans have other music videos or outdo or into music uh please send them over You can DM me on X or you can uh reach out I think Alex, you make your your link available Anyway, i email email me everyone My email is public information i All right So, let's talk about the great acceleration Kathy, uh going to hit a couple of slides on this topic Uh, here's the very first one uh you know projected shifts in GDP now through 2030 and the numbers are are pretty extraordinary you know your forecast of i global GDP growth uh it's a sort of a singularity event doubling IMFs uh we just had a conversation with Elon uh a friend of the pod talking about you know uh going ex on GDP growth in the next two years and tripledigit growth uh inside of uh you the next decades I mean insane numbers Uh, how do you think about it Kathy? i Yeah. So, and and you do a beautiful job with the the graphics here Uh, you can see that every technology revolution has been accompanied by a step function increase in GDP growth Uh, so go if you look at the if years from 1500 to 1900, uh not much new technology uh toward the end of it we were into railroads but uh and that uh according to Brett Winton and he worked with academic research uh on on this number uh real GDP growth was roughly uh 0.6% i globally And then as we went through railroads telephone electricity internal combustion engine",

Dave or Salem, you want to jump in i Well, you know I'll I'll give you the counterargument even though I don't believe in the counter I don't think any of us believe in the counter argument so I have to do it anyway But we you know Alex and I just got back from Davos, and I'd say you know if you randomly surveyed bankers and politicians you know 20% believe 80% don't believe The 80% that don't believe are saying \"Well, look when the computer revolution took off uh the GDP again settled at i annual growth No matter what we do we can't get out of this rut of i annual growth There's nothing that ever changes it And when you see incredible breakthroughs you know fusion or computing uh it's all baked into that 3%. So, we're always going to settle where we were And I think that mindset is just related to 125 years of history Uh, I love this chart because it shows prior periods of time So, you can zoom out from just your personal experience and start to look at world history experience and that that's what makes it clear But, you know pretend I'm I'm a nonbelievers What's your answer to that i Yes.

Oh, so what's interesting is again anything different Um and part of the reason for that is uh productivity growth uh it moved up in the is and is and that was a golden age for investing it moved up and we did uh we did sustain i GDP growth around the world not so much because of that I mean I think it part of it was partly necessary for that but also because China joined uh the joined after the world trade organization I think the reason they are talking like that is you're right we haven't been in a technology revolution before you know this is five we have five platforms forms they are converging They involve 15 different technologies and um and and the reason I think many people uh especially in the financial world do not believe this is because of the way they've set up their research They've set up their research by sector or industry or subindustry they've silted those sectors and industries when uh technology is permeating every one of them and blurring the lines So you almost have to set up research the way we have set it up and on purposefully uh and that is by these 15 technologies and each of our analysts is looking for to how to is researching how to understand when and how these technologies are going to scale across sectors Um so no silos here Our analysts are working together collaborating in order to understand the massive convergences that are taking place today i This is the perfect you know segue to this slide here from your deck which talked about the convergences that are coming In this case the convergence of being able to have reusable lowcost, you know access to flight and data centers in space Uh, and who would have ever thought you know one of the one of the conversations Dave and I had with Elon was you know no one was talking about data centers in space six months ago and then all of a sudden everybody's talking about them i Yes. And we uh we have an open-source SpaceX model out there uh we in collaboration with Mach 33 and uh we didn't we put it out early uh probably mid last year and we didn't have anything like uh the d the orbital data centers in our model So now we're going back to the drawing board with uh Mach 33 and yeah here are some of the early results that you're seeing the massive uh well first of all the cost decline again another use case driving unit growth and rights law is centered on unit growth for every cumulative",

It's not as high as that but it's well into the 20s, I believe i I wanted to ask you actually the on the left chart here um I was surprised the the line doesn't come down even more uh you know as as launch costs go down because one of my takeaways in that meeting with Elon was you know I I went in sort of half believing in data centers and space and came out completely sold One of the things that he's working on very aggressively and very secretly is when you make the actual GPU chips i uh there's about 50% margin at TSMC and then 80% margin at Nvidia. So there's you know the massive amount of cost increase baked into that value chain He's he's quietly bypassing all that and starting to plan out his own fast So then you look at well you know he always does this like what are the fundamental constraints What's the real underlying impenetrable barrier And it's it's the simple things like you know access to sand Well, that's dirt cheap Access to power Well, in space the power the solar panels are six times more efficient in space So, there's a massive reduction So, I think what we're looking at in this chart is just purely that if we reduce the launch cost today but there's no convergent disruption in cost per GPU, uh cost of power cost of producing the solar panels I think all those will happen concurrently over just a couple of years if Elon is right and and that that chart comes down really precipitously because because I think on the xu axis here we're just looking at cost per launch but we don't really factor in time i right uh so it's and and what's very interesting about that of course Moore's law was all about time um and it is no longer working in the semiconductor industry uh writes law is working in the semiconductor industry and so what can get in the way of unit growth is the question Um I I don't think regulations are going to get in the way I I think",

Kathy if you extrapolate out naively as I've pointed out on the pod in the past we get to a Dyson swarm type scenario where at some point we need enough atoms to build our orbital data centers just extrapolating naively that we start wanting to disassemble the moon and other solar system bodies planets asteroid belt Do you foresee I I know you you're you're very public about year forecasts but if I were to beseech you to extrapolate a little bit further maybe call it 50 years out i What is your position on the Dyson swarm Do we get a Dyson swarm Do we get 10 different competing Dyson swarms Do we get no Dyson swarm Alex is our resident planetary disconstructor deconstruct here The moon had it coming i Yeah. Well, um I'm probably not expert enough to answer that question but we we have taken the SpaceX model much further than five years and uh we have incorporated getting you know Optimus and and Tesla and Boring uh to Mars. Uh so uh so and and and we think that's very doable Um I think you know the the space our space analysts I'd really want them to dwell on this question I'd like to dwell on it with them Uh and I will do exactly that i Yeah. Well pretty pretty incredible You know orbital debris is for me the biggest showstopper uh in the near terms if in fact we have a deconstruction of a satellite in orbit that leads to a hyperexponential deconstruction of other satellites But let's not go there Let's talk about AI infrastructure Uh and and here's the slide Inference cost is collapsing at an extraordinary rate Uh and the and the implications of this are are massive and I don't think people realize it Um See, do you want to jump in on this one or do you want to let Dave come in I have a question that goes back connects this and the rockets and the GDP question and the question is the following i When you have technology being as deflationary as we see and we can see it",

So uh how do we project such a huge increase in GDP when technology is dropping the cost of everything so radically That's the the my big concern in terms of how we get to i paradox playing in here i Yeah. So uh uh the other side of costs coming down is of course explosive unit growth So that i plus GDP number is a real number i Uh so Javon to the rescue basically i Exactly. And you know many people especially in our industry just laugh at me us uh when we say we think uh prices are going to start falling This is another one of those well it's been stuck in the 2 to i range We're not getting out of there If you look at reflation which is um it measures 10,000 items in real time inflation is already down to 1.2% 2%. And yet the Fed is fighting uh this notion that we're up in the two and a half to i range and they're going to get it down to i by golly And you know that's how they potentially could overdo it But I think I think that uh within the next year we'll see inflation below i and heading negative And it is you've got critical to that forecast is productivity growth and uh uh unit labor costs uh continuing to decelerate Uh but also we've got gasoline costs coming down and here in the US we have housing costs rents starting to come down Uh at some point people are just going to it's going to become consensus thinking but it is as far away from that right now as you can get Well, I'm hoping by the end of this podcast that we've invented Kathy Wood's law Um there there seem to be between Moors law Wright's law Jevans paradox There there's seems to be an infinite number of these but they need they need names But you know the one that came up with Elon, I don't know if you watch the whole Elon podcast but I couldn't believe he told that story about the two economists walking through the woods and they pay each other to eat and it adds $200 to the global economy but nothing productive is created And and that dubtales with Selen's law you know which is hey if if AI cures breast cancer and millions and millions",

In reality if you wanted to you could still go and hang out you know and not get the radiation and pay if you wanted to and then not have the cancer And so it it adds huge net value to the world obviously but it shows up as negative GDP. So the so the GDP metric is fundamentally broken in the age of AI. So maybe Kathy Wood's law fixes this i It it is Um but there's there's another side to this I I'm not going to say it's equal and opposite Uh if you look at uh robotics and you look at the time we spend uh doing things for free we're not paid to drive our children around Uh we're not paid to make dinner and clean up afterwards um we're going to unlock a lot of that and that will become paid in the form of we're going to be buying robots uh that will get into GDP and that never got into GDP for before It's a little bit like uh what happened uh to the the farm economy here it The reason people at that time wanted to have lots and lots of children is they paid them room and board and and nothing else And then we had the industrial revolution Uh and of course their their work was not counted in GDP. Uh because there's GDP equals national income National income is easier to measure in these days because of the tax system and so forth And they have to equal they have to equal and so we will through robot uh um purchases uh see a lot of GDP coming back to us i That's a great point So you take traditional things that aren't measured and you move them into the measured economy and that increases radically Yes. Right. So this this reminds me of a specific data point I remember talking to VCs who all many missed investing in Uber and I actually interviewed one of them and said why And he said \"We totally messed up because the taxi market in San Francisco is about 500 million a years And we figured if Uber takes like 20% of that That's just not a venture investment because then they only get some chunk of that revenue What we missed was that the the ride sharing market quadrupled um and they took 80% market share from the taxis So you ended up all these people taking rides that you never would dream would take rides drunk people etch etch And",

And what we saw on that on the chart here put it up there once again is really the commodification of cognition right This is the most in the most important thing that drives all of human uh ultimately human economy and humanity is our intelligence And it's now becoming commodities at an extraordinary rate right 99% per years Uh i yes i it's a race to the bottom Uh but still you know the question is are the large language models going to be able with these reducing prices to maintain the revenues they're going to need to build the you know AI infrastructure Do you have any concerns about that about closing the economic loop on these frontier models i Well, it's been very interesting to watch open AI recently Um, and it is now starting to monetize It's planning for advertising uh for commerce for robots and uh but in in terms of the monetizations and we just learned they're going to start charging $60 per thousand per thousand it's um i per thousand views I think or or i Yeah, something like that Uh the equivalent uh at Facebook right now is $20. Um this is Super Bowl kinds of pricing Uh and and and they'll probably get away with it in the beginning because they'll control the supply but our analysts are beginning on the consumer side are saying \"Wait a minutes Wait a minutes You know Gemini is not going to do this i Uh they're not going to do this they're going to hang out and take share from uh from Open AI.

The thing the the thing is if you look at the prior slide and this slide together the the prior slide implies that cost of inference is going to zero um just because it's one pixel away from zero but it's not even close to zero when it's one pixel away from zero because the the desire to use these things in infinitely long thinking loops is astronomical and insatiable and so the the the demand is going to go through the roof no matter how cheap the inference gets because of exactly that effect you know Peter when you say it's 80% successful But if you launch a 100 agents your odds of it going from 80 to 90% success are very high and just one of them figures it out And and that's a brute force approach There are better approaches than that but the demand for intelligence is essentially infinite And and so that you know near zero",

It's not just techs It's like sunny or Arduino boards It's a cultural thing too where you can show your friends what you built last night and blow their minds Sorry, Kathy. I could i Yeah. No, not not I just wanted to clarify that it's uh Claude as in C L A W D. It's a little bit of a play on on the Claude we know and love anthropic So, um and a and it is open source uh our um our lead AI analyst uh has used it and already it's organized him I can tell I can tell how how much better organized he is having just a weekend with Cloudbot. i Yeah. Amazing. And what makes it different is it connects to all your social media accounts to your email account anything on your laptop Um, so it's incredibly powerful for automating your life showing your friends you know whatever in real time without getting in the loop And the reason it didn't come directly from the big AI labs is because it could also scramble your entire computer in two seconds if something goes wrong And and so it's it's a little bit dangerous that way So be be careful with it But that's also what makes it so powerful i Alex, what are your thoughts on the argentic slide here i Well, first I I'll point out it's no longer Claudebot.

I wrote about this in my newsletter today I I I think going back thought Kathy, I think you you raised a really interesting point that I haven't heard to my knowledge anyone else articulate which is so many people including folks on on this pod are hand ringing about GDP and oh won't hyperdelation somehow reveal the intrinsic misalignment between GDP growth and real wealth growth But you you've I think put your finger on a point I've never heard anyone else articulate which is that as humanity delegates more and more services to to agents that delegation looks like commerce from a GDP perspective that by basically carving up humanity individual humans roles and productive services and subdividing them all of the interactions between those subdivisions many of which are going to be agents add are accretive to GDP and look commerce So if anything you're you're painting a story for the exact opposite of how GDP statistics can explode in real terms while real wealth perhaps remains constant as well So I guess my question for you is if you could wave a magic wand and define Kathy Wood's perfect de definition not of GDP growth but of real wealth growth for humanity how would you define it i Well, wealth growth is very much tied to productivity growth uh and I'm talking about real wealth growth I'm not talking about real estate and priced driven uh you know I'm talking more about i uh technologically enabled productivity gains um that you know we got a taste of it just a taste from the is and is um it was it was the in the previn age starting with a PC then previn age um and and pre-mobile age But back then which was a magnificent time for the financial markets wealth creation uh was stupendous as software for the first time unlocked We went through a frustrating period in in the 80s. I was there uh where technology it almost seemed as though it was hurting productivity Um there were some people out there saying that and then of course Microsoft came along and and boom and then we had the internet boom Um so that was foreshadowing just foreshadowing what we're going to experience here So there was if you look at growth growth accelerated not a lot but it accelerated",

So, so maybe just a followup Kathy, on that So, this seems like the crux of not just some of these amazing visuals but also I think your broader thesis in investing that GDP may be not the best macro indicator for progress It sounds like you're saying something like per capita productivity is the key macro indicator you look to But I I guess I'm curious e even per capita productivity ultimately you have to resolve that quantitatively down to units of dollars or or some other units and your your investments via ETFs. Uh I I think the the question in my mind is like what is the right benchmark to hold yourself to you're you're very clearly in the business of investing in the future Uh and the the broader call it the S&P 500 may or may not you know m Mr. Market is a little bit psychotic sometimes may or may not be properly measuring progress toward the future What if if you had to put a single metric to it what metric is it that we can all sort of sit down and calculate that that you're optimizing for you think that progress itself should be indexed against Well, first of all in terms of indexation that that is a live wire for me because uh that is what has happened to the financial markets Unfortunately, they have and and Elon Musk feels very strongly about this We had a an X spaces uh session with him",

And uh I think we will but again most people think you know there in our business their eyes roll because they're so wedded to these benchmarks Now, if if I'm going to try and get at an economic measure of progress I'm going to look while most people focus on GDP that is uh the other side of uh gross national income which is measured uh we get a lot of information",

Um, and I think this is driving very much of the you know Trump policies today Uh, David Sax speaks about this currently This has been a large conversation just coming back from Davos. i And, you know there's at the same time we have people speaking about we need to slow down because we don't understand where we're heading in with the emergence of AGI and or ASI, whatever you want to call it But the boogeyman is if the US doesn't dominate um it it has a chance of failing globally financially And by the way the number uh you know we can talk about the US dollar as a as a global currency reserve which has been falling in terms of its uh uh you know utilization globally which is a which is a challenge at the same time that this is going on So, uh would you take a second and and walk us through this chart um that is from your report i Yes, we have been tracking all of the the models large language models coming out of China.

Linux uh has been the poster child i We as in the US you're saying i uh uh we US forced China because we stopped selling our software into China.

Maltbot with its mascot being M Mr. Lobster. i That had to be just yesterday right i Kathy, you're not you're not more than 24 I guess 24 hours in AI time is like a years But Kathy, Alex's favorite book and I think Dave and I are right behind him on this is a book called Accelerando that opens in chapter 1 with the neuronal structure of lobsters being beamed out to the universe and it goes from there But Alex tracks the news at minute-to-minute levels So, so feeling like you're behind Alex is totally normal for everybody i Well, you know it's interesting We just got out of our morning meeting and usually I'm right on we are all right on top of all of this So, thank you for for letting me know I'll let everyone else know And you know the interesting thing about lobsters I'm on the board of the Dolly Museum here in St. Pete. There are only two Dolly Museums, uh one in Barcelona and one here Uh, he featured lobsters in his art regularly Um, so I'm going to have to read this book Yes. i I think lo I've made made the point in my newsletter lobsters are the new mascots for the singularity i It's so interesting because i I'll text it to you Kathy.

So, maybe that's where this is going And I was just on a a call it's called the Bitcoin brainstorm um with uh Alex Gladstein who's uh now become infatuated with uh AI as well as Bitcoin and how they can work together Uh but he was all over Cloudbot and it's just I mean it's just taking the world by fire And so this is individual agency at work here uh not the big companies at work So, it's going to be fascinating to see where this goes Um anyway so I'm glad we're hopping back into the open source mo movement If you look at and we have this in uh in in big ideas as well If you look at investment as a share of GDP uh and now this includes property and it's both in China and the US. In the US, our share of GDP is a little north of 20%. In China, it's 40%. And it's been there since they moved into the World Trade Organization. So, their quote unquote investment now pro it includes property but we know that property is deflating big time there So their investment is staying up at that 40% range because Xi Ping has moved away from uh solely common prosperity as uh the slogan towards new productive forces that's all about technology So they are pouring money pouring money into this and uh we should be on guard and I think it's great that we know about their open-source movement uh because there's nothing like competition to get the US going Uh so I actually think the competition is very good and if you want to see uh uh China at work um in in AI as applied to health care it's unbelievable and Peter I I know you've talked about this Yeah. i It's unbelievable what's going on Alex Alexov uh who's in who's the CEO of Encilico Medicine just went public on the Hong Kong exchange i 1,200 times overs subscribed and I talked to I just talked to him in uh he was in Beijing yesterday I was zooming with him and uh the market there in biotech is exploding It is i it is uh and the companies are going",

And part of that is our regulation is so uh much more strict than theirs That is changing i Yeah. The new FDA commissioner is doing a great job uh you know bringing down barriers See, can I hear your voice in the US versus China conversation here i Yeah, I I continue to think that as we kind of push towards abundance that this tension is less relevant I also kind of made the point in the last podcast that I think um this will be won or lost at the application layer and I think the US has such a massive lead in the application layer that uh it'll it'll win there I mean the it's incredible to me how much the US via Silicon Valley thinking has blown the world apart and taken over on all application with one exception of Tik Tok and maybe Spotify but other than that i what about the energy layer here the inner i huge as we bring energy closer to the inner loop uh it'll be a huge challenge that was definitely true i I think Kathy's point on open source though is is far more important than that makes it sound because you know when when you look at the number of people actually working on these core algorithms inside Anthropic and OpenAI. It's a tiny tiny tiny group of people and they're super arrogant They think they're the smartest people in the history of algorithms and you know on and on and on and as soon as you move all the research out of open source and into just the closed models the number of ideas that can flow into the US version of it gets throttled tremendously and it does capture all the money and and it does also address the safety issues i but it also slows the innovation like crazy So cloud versus must cloud/multbot, right That's the application layer making it available to anybody to implement their functionality and that's where open source thrives and that's frankly where the US really thrives i Well, it's consistent too with past Chinese, you know in Chinese past races to to catch up You know they they poison the air poison the water whatever Just run Don't worry about the regulatory issues Don't worry about the toxic fumes coming out We need to",

It's not like it's it's hidden in China. But I really do believe the open source community innovates much much more quickly But it's also very very dangerous in terms of you know all all the negative use cases i It's interesting that uh our government has had nothing to say about Meta Platforms acquiring Manis. Now maybe they will Their Manis is open source uh Chinese uh company as well Um, and it is also interesting to have watched Sam Alman and Jensen Wong uh when when they talked about deepseek they said hey that algorithm was pretty clever you know you know kudos to to China and and the deepseek uh founder uh but guess what uh that has given us the opportunity to distill uh into our own models So it's very interesting on the software side Our government's not having much to say u but uh the hardware side of course it has much more to say This episode is brought to you by Blitzy autonomous software development with infinite code context Blitzy uses thousands of specialized AI agents that think for hours to understand enterprisecale code bases with millions of lines of code Engineers start every development sprint with the Blitzy platform bringing in their development requirements The Blitzy platform provides a plan then generates and pre-ompiles code for each task Blitzy delivers 80% or more of the development work autonomously while providing a guide for the final 20% of human development work required to complete the sprint Enterprises are achieving a ex engineering velocity increase when incorporating Blitzy as their preIDE development tools pairing it with their coding copilot of choice to bring an AI native SDLC into their orgy Ready to ex your engineering velocity Visit blitzy.com to schedule a demo and start building with Blitzy today i Um, I'm going to move us to our our next topic here Just a quick shout out to Google because I end up using Google Slides here and the beautification function Kathy is what makes i interesting It's like we have to do this i Yeah, they're Google Google's AI does an incredible job at beautifying slides So just uh you know the right tool for the right the right purpose i Absolutely. i Peter, I got to I got to hand it to you You moved off PowerPoint.",

Um, i yes i So, uh you know I you were on stage with me live a few years ago um and then on video two years ago um because of uh uh COVID, but uh your prediction of getting to a million dollars of Bitcoin, uh do you still hold out for that kind of a a target uh what are you seeing that gives you hope even while we're seeing this uh uh recent downturn Uh give us your sort of thoughts and projections on Bitcoin, Kathy. i Sure. Uh we have not moved off that that's our bull case one and a half million in 2030. Uh that there are a few compositional changes uh one stable coins so especially tether in the emerging markets uh ha have usurped the one of the roles that we thought bitching would serve and that is we thought that before stable coins that people would and they were they would um buy bitching as an insurance policy against uh confiscation of wealth either in the form of inflation hyperinflation and massive devaluations uh which occur regularly in the emerging markets or outright confiscation of wealth Uh and so stable coins now serve that purpose Stable coins are backed effectively by the US dollars So and therefore are hostage to our fiat u monetary system Uh so that that would have taken our price target down by 200 to $300,000. On the other side what has happened to gold recently Gold has doubled over the last two years uh and uh and has outperformed Bitcoin royally in in the last years Uh so the digital gold role and we think with intergenerational wealth transfers accelerating here throughout the world uh that the younger generation will diversify into a digital gold uh option rather than the physical gold it's more their world and uh so we think that role has uh increased or that that that the price should be supported by what has happened to gold Now if you look at a correlation matrix between 20 and 25 the correlation between Bitcoin and gold has been almost nonexistent i 0.14 uh and so uh but if you look at what's happened historically certainly the last two cycles gold has led Bitcoin so we think Bitcoin is getting ready for another big big run What has happened in the last few months is uh uh is 1010.

It is going its supply is is now rising more slowly than gold's uh supply because miners gold miners can just go out and you know uh uh they can respond to this price signal So their mining has picked up Um but what about the deflation side Well, if you think about 089 which was the catastrophic deflation uh threatened a financial a global financial bust uh introducing all",

She's Iranian and her her parents are still in Iran. And all the transactions for years now at the bazaar where we used to buy rice and stuff when I was a kids they're all done with Bitcoin. Everybody has to have a phone The only way you can actually buy things is with Bitcoin. And you know that that's been going on for years I think it's probably illegal nobody cares and now you've got a revolution You know obviously the currency is completely unusable at this stage It's, you know the the country is teetering on the brink i So, and I noticed in the blockchain ledger reports you know this is a couple years ago a hugely disproportionate fraction of transactions i come from Iran. So this will be a good bell weather because you know that kind of disruption you know Venezuela and all around the world you look at just massive fraction of the of the population of the world lives in unstable places So if all of Iran moves to Bitcoin because people are going to be fleeing the country imminently as quickly as they can get out then that's a bellwether and a case study for what could happen to probably you know over half the population of the world with all the disruption that's coming I I have I have an I have an Arc Invest worthy tracking system um which is um the market cap of gold is almost 20 times that of Bitcoin but the daily trading volume of Bitcoin is only a quarter of what gold is is already a quarter So the proportionately the amount of trading volume of Bitcoin is way way exceeds that of gold and I find that a really fascinating indicator",

Does the ICO replace the IPO or how's that going to work i Yeah.

So, something is going to change There's no there's no doubt about that It's just that you know anytime that there's any kind of fear in the world it all falls back to well I can trust the SEC. You can trust you know GAP accounting And and at the end of the day if everything trades privately i General Electric, i I mean look A6Z is 90 billion now General catalyst is 60 billion That's a fair amount of money But by Kathy Wood standards that's a joke right In the Kathy world the numbers start at",

And so so yeah there there's another level of scale we need to penetrate somehow i Dave, on that u on that note a question for you Kathy. Are we going to see hundred trillion dollar companies by 2030? We're seeing the i trillion company now We're about to see SpaceX go public maybe merge with Tesla. curious about whether you think which way Elon's going to get liquidity for SpaceX or stability Is it going to be a merger or an IPO? And then you know can we see tens of trillions or hundred trillion dollar valuation on companies What are your thoughts there i Yeah, it's interesting Um, and I'm not sure if he said it on your podcast I'm not quite sure where I heard this but uh uh he talked about he said you know I I can see convergences among my companies that I didn't expect Uh and we we've been saying that for some time because you know in in the world of AI, what do you have to have to win You have to have proprietary data And think about all the proprietary data he has different kinds of proprietary data Tesla, the language of the roads Um, Neuralink, uh he's got Multiomics data now uh to source Uh, space nobody else has that data Um, X, nobody else has that data either So, um and Boring, no one no one has that data So, I could see yes 100red trillion I think it's I think it's going to happen because of convergence The i converging trillion dollar company come on come online by 2030. i I I think there could be and but but I and you know the the leading candidate is is Tesla for the reason I just said and there could be some combinations uh taking place as part of that Uh so you know it is interesting also uh I know there are rumors about SpaceX lining up bankers and I never thought that SpaceX would go public I didn't think it needed to go public I don't and I you know I think Elon's experience with Tesla in the public markets hasn't been you know the most welcoming Um, so but you know I think if I if SpaceX were to go public it is because of these this orbital data center opportunity Uh, and there you have it Right. i That was on this pod actually Kathy.

But I'm I'm curious in as part of your technical thesis we're surely moving to a world of super intelligence to the extent we're not there already where super intelligence is itself an active trader in the market already on a a daily volume from a daily volume perspective volume is completely dominated by ALGO traders At at what point does it make sense due to an abundance of super intelligence not even to bother with actively managed ETFs anymore and just let indexing take over So that's a great question Again, uh algorithms are yeah certainly there's a pattern recognition part uh to algorithms but if you think about um AI, AI should obliterate the the the benchmark sensitive portfolios And you",

The link is down below So, uh increasingly efficient energy is powering the global economy We're seeing kilowatt hours per dollar of GDP drop We're seeing global capacity increase Um, a lot of solar again mostly from China that's running circles around us i At the same time we're seeing uh the uh cost of solar and batteries decline I mean incredible progress on batteries in the last in the last years Uh so these two things I mean I don't think people real I mean they realize and you know our subscribers listen to this show regularly realize it because we talk about how critical energy is fundamentally it ties to not only GDP but standards of living and health and education to every nation on the planet and especially with data centers right now uh fundamental to dominance as a nation state uh thoughts on this Kathy? i Yeah, if you go back to the last chart one of the things I find fascinating um we focused a lot on nuclear in this in this uh big ideas but look at the yes the efficiency of all country or major countries but China is half as efficient that's a bit of an exaggeration as those other countries Um now what is it doing to offset that it is building they may have more now 28 large nuclear reactors i uh uh at one time the US is not building one large I know we're we're uh we're re engaging with some of the old ones but uh I think our regulatory stance is changing there dramatically and we will um it so that that's one thing I took away from from that um you know I I think uh what what's wonderful about innovation and and what you do is helping people understand what they're saying Yes, we we need to become more energy efficient A given and we are becoming more energy efficient Economic activity is energy transformed you are helping people understand that uh others who just blindly say energy is bad are not thinking clearly about what they're saying They're basically saying they want us to turn back to the dark dark ages Um if we're going to progress we're going to use more energy What's also interesting about the nuclear side of this is",

Uh assuming you're from assuming you're familiar with that I is it your view that nuclear or the overregulation perhaps of nuclear energy is what happened to the US economy in 1971 that set us on a different course Uh, I think that going off the gold exchange standard closing the gold window and not having monetary policy linked to anything except human frailty actually Um, was and then of course we had wage price controls all kinds of distortions and just a general increase in regulations Uh, and nuclear epitomized that that happened in 1974 or 75 I think Um so yes it was that that moment uh going off the gold exchange standard having no discipline uh oil prices quadrupled almost immediately and uh set us off on a on a very bad course i and we stopped sending humans to the moon A number of things happened around the same time i Yes. Yes. And then ergonomics the combination of uh vulgar and ergonomic policies which are being repeated today The the deregulation tax cuts Our corporate tax rate our effective corporate tax rate now in the United States is I think the lowest in the developed world down from nearly the highest um before the Trump in his first administration started cutting the tax rates The depreciation schedules in the new tax law are astonishing uh and they favor innovation and favor innovation in this country So being able to depreciate a manufacturing structure completely in its first year of service instead of over 30 to 40 years the companies who build manufacturing facilities here in the United States, as long as they start before 28, end of 28, uh they will get huge tax refunds that they can then plow back into R&D and cutting prices i Pardon? i Re-industrializing. i Yes, we are We are Um it's I think we",

Uh before I do that um so Dave just said something very important I think which is um great teams you have to start there Um and what's happening and the reason we're seeing these pivots being very successful is convergences between and among the technologies to create entirely new industries Um and and so there are many many more opportunities to pivot So the risk if you if you of you know passing on a deal because you you say wait a minute we're going to regulation is going to be a showstopper here Maybe maybe not you know if there's a pivot in the way that boom pivoted uh which is right into regulatory arms you know the the regulators want this world to happen Uh so I think that that's important i Cumulative investment in global power needs to increase to 10 trillion by 2030. So it's just making the case that we're going to be massive investments into power i Yes. Yes. Yes. No question about it No question about it There are going to be trillions of dollars invested into AI everything And this is all related to AI. i Yeah. Um, i I'm I'm curious Kathy, also u just on this energy theme Perhaps you've seen the Apple TV show for all mankind that posits an alternative history where nuclear energy in particular is fast forwarded because the space race humans landing on the moon was never won by the US. Soviets landed first so the space race continued I'm curious in the vein of an alternative future history and and you speak the language of rights law and more broadly experience curves How far behind do you think we are relative to where we could have been if things had not gone off the rails as it were in the early to mid 1970s? Are we decade behind 50 years behind Where should we be by now I think I I think the energy side of things meaning nuclear in particular um I can't say we're behind I can say we're behind new construction now but in the United States, nuclear does account for 20% of our electricity generation",

So, they've kind of hurt themselves a little bit in in that way Uh but that doesn't take away from the entrepreneurial zeal and and frankly I think competition makes both of us better i for sure I I maintain that the entrepreneurship in China is so deep and so native they need socialism to put a lid on it Otherwise, they'd sell their grandmother for a profit Well, and that's why Xiinping recently has been um has been making the case for anti-involution.

But let's jump in So, the news of course is rob taxis are finally here Uh we've seen uh we've seen Whimo uh and uh we've seen obviously caber taxis coming online We've just heard that Uber and Lucid uh and Nvidia is putting their own fleet on the roads And of course there are dozens of equivalents in China. Uh so here are the numbers Uh Whimo's on the rise and Lyft uh and Uber's on the decline Uh, and we're going to be seeing here you know rob taxi miles and cumulative miles just spike Uh, and you know when I'm on the road here in Santa Monica, as I'm driving back and forth to the airport or my kids to school whatever we'll I'll we'll we'll do a count of how many Whimos we see i And uh on an average day right now it's probably about 10 or 12 Whimos on the streets here Uh, and I'm imagining in about four or five years it's going to be 80% autonomous vehicles i What do you think i We think so i We agree Uh, we agree Uh, and in this book as well you'll see uh that we expect Tesla to be the biggest winner from a platform point of view Whimo will be second and the reason is uh Whimo's cost structure it's dependent unlike Tesla which is vertically integrated that's Elon's preference and modes operand uh Whimo is not and in fact for a time there they had trouble attracting an auto supplier uh so now they're working with Ziker and Hyundai and a few others um they have fewer than 3,000 cars throughout the United States. So for you to see 10 in one run uh says they're probably concentrated close to where you are i already So that's that's interesting uh but we think that Tesla's solution from a cost point of view will be 50% lower than Whimo's and therefore it will be able to charge less Now between now and then there's huge amount of room for both of them uh to compete against Uber andy because you know with surge pricing Uber's average average price over the last four years has gone up 40% with surge pricing and so forth So from i to $2.80",

And I I completely didn't get it until we went to the the uh Gigafactory. Um I I thought Elon, you know you you don't like suppliers just cut you're a control freak And it's just not true He doesn't like suppliers because he sees the exponential opportunity to manufacture The demand is going to go through the roof overnight i And the only way to fulfill that demand is to turn raw aluminum into a car on the other side or raw chips You have to build all this stuff internally and plan ahead But if you have even a single component in your supply chain like Whimo does that's constrained then the entire supply chain has to wait for that one component i Absolutely. i So so there's be yeah infinite demand for both Whimo and Tesla but Tesla will make far far more cars more quickly because because Elon is thinking about doing everything inside that fully exponential automated internal supply chain Sorry See, I cut you off there I think one huge advantage Tesla also has if they allow people to own their own cars and turn those into taxis that will be a massive it's much more exponential organizations friendly where you don't want to own your own assets right this is why Uber scales so fast and I think that is a massive area of opportunity i Kathy on the convergence conversation are you tracking the idea that millions of autonomous caber taxis are inference engines and energy storage devices moving around cities Oh yes Oh yes And also tuning into what Elon says regularly about how inefficient our grid is right now You know it's not used very much at night and you know uh and and overly used sometimes during the day depending on the weather So um uh yes uh distributed energy ecosystems Absolutely. No, it's just it's amazing to me how much people underappreciate that if when you look at a a Tesla Gigafactory, you know right across the street you've got the Optimus factory going up you've got the data center All of the components in this are general purpose i When you look at Ford or GM and you say \"Well, what do you guys do Well, we",

They're pulling back but they're thinking rob taxis trying to figure their how how do I inside my way insinuate my way into it i Um, this is all going to be one thing And Tesla's Tesla figured this out Elon figured it out you know in his first master plan Maybe it was the second one but whatever He figured it out so long ago It was there for them to see if they had if they had decided to take him serious i I can't see the automotive industry surviving this I mean it's going to be integrated with AI so that your AI knows your schedule You're working towards the front walking towards the front door It sees you opening the handle It knows where you're going to go and autonomous car is waiting for you there i Yeah. i Without you even asking for it It's just it's seamless automagical futures that are coming I I think the key the key point here is that we only need a few tens of millions of cars to cover all of the US vehicular needs right And right now we sell 90 million cars globally new cars a years This is insane over supply i But I think there's effect by comparison effectively infinite demand for robots in different shapes and sizes So I I'll take the position I I think here I do see the automotive industry surviving It'll just evolve into robots in the same way that bicycles arguably plus carriages evolved in some sense into airplanes and automobiles i Totally right But the the sector survives and gets bigger than ever But then within the sector if you look under the covers at some of these companies they're not positioned at all",

Yeah. i And energy storage was as well because energy storage so electric vehicle costs continue to fall The internal combustion engine costs is a completely mature industry According to Wright's law for a cumulative doubling from this level would take them I don't know a hundred years So they are not riding down any cost curve the way they would be if they stuck to electric vehicles which are writing down a cost curve The learning curve I i I think we we may also be leaving out a very important component which is as Elon would call it the machine that makes the machine We're talking about ice versus electric But the very important component I think we're leaving out is how they're made And right now legacy auto companies lean heavily on unionized human labor Totally. much of that is going to be automated with robots So I I guess question in question form for Kathy, do you think maybe barrier to competition that Tesla has is that at least among American car companies it's leaning more heavily into robotized automation for manufacturing in a way that the legacy manufacturers aren't or can't i with without a doubt And you know Elon, I'm going to say about maybe it was three or four years ago he said you know I've I've discovered that you know I'm a manufacturer of factories And that was an important that was an important aha moment for us as well um because he was designing the manufacturer you know the manufacturing or the factories of the future and he had the right technologies involved Uh so yes i well also to to Alex's point you know when when you know the original Gigafactory is in California and when",

I'm never coming back This is insane So now he's in Texas and and building in a much better regulatory environment But if you look at the legacy car companies and the unions and the how tied those unions are to the voter pool in those regions i and and the pension plans it's like it's just impossible to escape And so starting a new clean sheet of paper in a new jurisdiction is actually cheaper than retooling a legacy car company i Yes. And it's worse in Europe where they have in Germany for example they have worker councils that determine what uh BMW or Mercedes are allowed to do as a corporation which is i totally right Totally. And this this is something you know big deal in Davos like Europe doesn't have a place to go like if you want to hide your money you can go to Likenstein or Monaco but if you want to build a cheap car company in an unregulated environment or less regulated no not unregulated at all just like rational environment where do you got And there's i they'll go to Ukraine. No, they'll go to Ukraine in the future Ukraine will go to go to special economic zones like Texas. i I know that most people think Europe is completely lost And from a technology and regulatory point of view um I think the collapse of innovation individual agency will help But from a macro level I agree with that But uh and Peter age of abundance So I'm looking for scarcity Obviously Bitcoin comes uh to mind Uh but the other thing what does Europe have that other countries don't have Why do we all go there for vacations i Buildings, i the lifestyle i Lifestyle. i The lifestyle easy going the food the So I wouldn't write off Europe. It's just they're going to serve the rest of the world in in in the way they always have um lifestyle service cute pizzas and espresso i I'll make my prediction on this So the talent the latent tent pool in Europe is like you would not believe Brilliant brilliant people i I agree i And historically people from India flood the US make a ton of money then they go retire wherever they want to retired Europeans don't do it because it's so hard to leave Europe. It's so wonderful Uh but I think that the disparity is getting so wide now that the actual entrepreneurial community is going to start flocking to the US, work 10 years whatever keep your place in Europe and",

I love it i Yes. i Yes. And he started what was so what's so beautiful about that story is he started in Rwanda. Yes. i Um sending medical supplies and I think he cut the mortality rate of the m you maternal maternal bleedouts from pregnancy by huge amount i More than 50%. i Yes. Wow. i Yes. i So, we're seeing uh autonomous delivery in the air uh from Zipline and Wing. Uh Matnet, which was a spin out from Singularity University. Shout out to them On the ground we got Starlink and Mtoan and Cocoa Robots. Again, there dozens i probably 50 Coco robots I see in the street of Santa Monica here Uh and then of course we're seeing the beginning of trucking It's interesting The the ground is crowded The air the airways are open but it will eventually get crowded I mean if we start seeing delivery rates uh that could be from airline and wings Um, you know I'm",

They won't get physically crowded but you're right The noise is going to be a major major issue If someone invents a silent drone that's that's be a total game Quieter. Yeah. Well, it's hard i Gravity shielding Alex. When do we get gravity shielding Alex? i Working on it Peter. Ask me in a few years i Okay. i Seriously, ask me in a few years Um, I I maybe just a closing question if I may for for Kathy. A a lot of this is premised on labor being substituted for by intelligence and and automation In my mind there's another possibility once we've fully swapped out AI and automation and robotics and drones for human labor There's still capital left And historically the the the debate from all the isms at the beginning of the with century was largely premised on labor versus capital But do you think it's possible that automation could also substitute for capital at some point in the next few years Could capital be replaced by automation or is capital in some sense immortal I think blockchain technology is going to transform everything in uh financial services but that's more the infrastructure and bringing more efficiencies into I think capital is should I say immortal you know that's a very that's quite absolute and can I think of a a reason it wouldn't be um i well blockchain for example with with blockchain the fundamentally blockchains and yes to to everyone in the audience who's about to lecture me on the increasing difficulty of Bitcoin. I I I know how that works preemptively Um with with with with blockchains uh proof of work in particular blockchain proof of work is fundamentally based on the difficulty of inverting a hash function So in some sense it's a bet against it's a bet against automation getting smart enough to be able to efficiently invert hash functions It's sort of an anti-technology bet in some sense So I would say yeah even with blockchain blockchain is just as immortal in some sense as the ability for AI to not solve math is which is I think pretty pretty bold bet if one's going to make one We've been using money as a main mode of discourse in the world for the last several hundred years about capitalism profits business It's the it's the main conversation I think we're shifting from money to information",
