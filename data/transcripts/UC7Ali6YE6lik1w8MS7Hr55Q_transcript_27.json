        "text": " Microsoft's AI CEO returns to explain why the company is now pushing for super intelligence, what that means, and how Microsoft is moving forward after its latest Open AI deal. That's coming up right after this. Welcome to Big Technology Podcast, a show for coolheaded and nuanced conversation [music] of the tech world and beyond. Today we're joined once again by Mustafa Sullean, the CEO of Microsoft AI and also the [music] head of the company's new super intelligence team, who is here to speak with us about what that means, what super intelligence is, but [music] more broadly what the future of this technology is going to look like and whether we're at the end of the curve or the [music] beginning or somewhere in the middle. Anyway, we'll get into it all. Mustafa, great to see you again. Welcome to the show. Hey, Alex. , great to see you again. Thanks for having me. It's always a pleasure. And so recently you wrote this post about a new push towards what you call humanist super intelligence at Microsoft. You say you're working towards it. What you call incredibly advanced AI capabilities that always work for in service of people and humanity more generally. Let me ask you a question about this. It's so interesting to me to see so many labs running towards what they call super intelligence, which I guess is sort of like a cooler version of AGI. , as the research is mixed about whether we're going to see a lot more progress with the current paradigm, a lot of people are talking about diminishing marginal returns. I think we've talked about that. There's some questions about the viability of LLMs in terms of pushing the state-of-the-art and AI forward. And yet it's we're also seeing you know this push towards super intelligence. So just explain as we begin sort of the discrepancy there. Why are we hearing so much about super intelligence where we're not even sure if the current methods are going to get us to the step before which is AGI? Yeah. I mean super intelligence and AGI are really goals rather than methods. And I think that the ambition is to create superhuman performance at most or all human tasks. like we want to have medical super intelligence. We want to have the best expertise in medical diagnosis be cheap and abundant and available to billions of people around the world. we also want to have worldclass legal advice on tap that costs almost nothing few bucks a month. we want to have financial advice. We want to have emotional support. We want to have software engineers available on tap. And I think that the project of super intelligence is about saying what type of very very powerful intelligence systems are we actually going to build? And what I'm trying to propose is that we subject each of these new technologies to a very simple test. Like does it in practice",

And what I'm trying to propose is that we subject each of these new technologies to a very simple test. Like does it in practice civilization? And does it always keep humanity at the top of the food chain? it sounds like a kind of simplistic or obvious thing to have to declare, but the goal of science and technology, science and technology in my opinion is like to advance human civilization, to keep humans in control and to create benefits for all humans. And I think in some of the rhetoric in the last few years, you can feel that there's a little bit of like you know a kind of creeping assumption that it is inevitable that these kinds of systems exceed our control and our capability and move beyond us as a species, as a human species. And I'm pushing back on that idea with the framing around humanist super intelligence. So I think it's quite different. [snorts] But then is your view that super intelligence won't be one broad intelligence that it will be you can maybe achieve super intelligence in one discipline when it's smarter than let's say the best doctors in medicine but maybe it's just like not there in accounting for example. One way of thinking about it is that how we train these models at the moment is that we work through verticals and we make sure that we have training data knowledge expertise reasoning traces chains of thought that reflect the kinds of activities that people do in each one of these disciplines to build their expertise overall. So we're already training generalist models from a verticalized position. We're starting off by saying what specific tasks are we trying to optimize and you know the project of humanist super intelligence is first trying to say what good will this technology do and how will it be safe and controllable and aligned to human interests and one of those dimensions of safety is verticalization. If a model has been designed explicitly to achieve medical super intelligence, then by definition it isn't going to be the best software engineer in the world, it isn't going to be the best mathematician or physicist. And so narrowing the domain, not too much, not entirely because you can't collapse it, but narrowing it and reducing the generality is one of the ways that I think is likely to help create more control. It's not the only solution. There are many other aspects of like how we achieve containment and alignment but domain specific models are one part of it. Is it possible that something can be super intelligent but not generally intelligent? Like is it possible that maybe super intelligence happens without AGI because AGI is all about generality and what you're talking about is not.",

Like is it possible that maybe super intelligence happens without AGI because AGI is all about generality and what you're talking about is not. they need to be general. they need to transfer knowledge from one domain to another. they need to you know have generalist reasoning capabilities. But when you apply it and you put it into production and [snorts] you let it have more autonomy to make decisions or you let it generate arbitrary code to solve a particular problem or you let it write its own evals so that it can modify its own code and generate new prompts to generate new training data to write new evals to then iterate on its own performance. these capabilities, autonomy, goal setting, writing code, modifying itself, you know, if you add to that then also a perfectly generalized model or or sort of general purpose model, that's a very very very powerful system which today I don't think anybody really knows how we would contain or align something like that. And so it's not to say that we should not do any one of those dimensions. It's just to outline a road map of capabilities which we're all working on which add more risk especially when they compound with one another and you combine them all together. And so you know my claim is that we should just approach this with caution remembering that we don't want to bundle together all these capabilities so that there's a higher risk of a you know recursively self-improving exponential takeoff that then replaces our species. And I think that that is very low probability from what I see today. But it's one that we have to take seriously in the next like 10 years or so. Okay. I do want to get to that in a bit. But let me tell you what I find odd about these conversations. And I want to go back to the first question that I asked you which is researchers are talking about how the current methods are leveling off. give you one example. Data is not plentiful. synthetic data not very not very useful yet. power might be running out and you need that scale a lot of people say in order to make these models better or at least even to run the basic capabilities. So given the limitations of LLMs are you seeing something that we're not that will sort of pave the way to super intelligence? I mean how do you get from here to there? Look, I I think we're power limited but not fundamentally power constrained. , clearly there's like huge appetite to build bigger data centers and train in larger more contiguous clust more fully connected clusters. So clusters where all the chips are connected to each other but that's",

        "text": "here to there? Look, I I think we're power limited but not fundamentally power constrained. , clearly there's like huge appetite to build bigger data centers and train in larger more contiguous clust more fully connected clusters. So clusters where all the chips are connected to each other but that's not holding back progress. Obviously if we had more right now it would definitely help but there's many many other things in the stack that are slowing down progress. If we are not data constrained right now, we're generating vast amounts of highquality synthetic data which is proving to be useful. obviously again the same is also true like more highquality data would be great but I I don't see an a slowing down in progress because of either of those two things. , if anything, the rate of progress has been insane over the last five years. And to expect us to continue to make doublings every three months in the size of clusters that are trained for the largest models, you know, given the base that we're now starting from when training runs are often, you know, 50 megawatt or 100 megawatt or soon 500 megawatt. You know, you can't just double on that every six months. There's there's like the laws of physics kind of do create restrictions and we're talking about tens of billions of dollars of you know cluster. So pace might slow a little maybe but it's also clear that pace is still going to be unbelievably fast like you know sort of sort of objectively speaking. So I I I don't see or fear or currently feel any sense that things are slowing down or that we're losing momentum. This is the quite the opposite. Well, then let me ask it this way. Do you think LLMs are the way there? , look, I think one thing to consider is that , every year for the last few years, there's been a major new contribution to the field, still principally based around the transformer architecture. , but we're bending the transformer architecture into new shapes all the time. fine-tuning emerged three years ago on top of our pre-trained models to adapt them to specific use cases. they're now fully multimodal which requires further changes and the introduction of diffusion models. then we had reasoning models in the last 12 months which again are still funly fundamentally based on the same core architecture things are just rearranged slightly differently. so you know even though the scaling laws weren't able to continue exponentially in the way they had from such a low base new methods appear on top of those like reasoning and new methods will come you know even newer methods will come soon too. So for example I expect that there's going to be quite a lot of progress in recurrency soon right the moment you know the models don't kind of attend to their working memory very well",

So for example I expect that there's going to be quite a lot of progress in recurrency soon right the moment you know the models don't kind of attend to their working memory very well they're training right and so you know I think people are experimenting with lots of different types of loss function and lots of training objectives you know the other one is memory like I think memory is getting better and better and I think is going to totally change what's possible And the other one is the the sort of length of a task horizon that can be predicted. So at the moment it's like a few steps but soon it will be tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of steps accurately and that'll mean that a model can like use APIs or query a human or check another database or call on another AI. And so that will be another like sort of exponential lift when something like any one of those three things work. You'll get another kind of you know rapid acceleration in progress. So I don't think there's anything fundamentally wrong with the LLM architecture and I don't think we're fundamentally compute or data constrained. I think that there are so many people focused on this problem now. There are just going to be more and more you know breakthroughs coming. Okay, that's very interesting. So your perspective basically is that LM are the path. Yeah. That we don't need another breakthrough. That's a different model format to get toward super intelligence. Well, I mean so far no I don't think so. I mean so far deep learning and the transformer model has been the workhorse for I I guess like 12 years you know you know since Alexet and you know there's been variations on a theme but it's it's been delivering and I I don't think it's fair to say that it's like not delivering at the moment. I think it's I think it's really making a lot of progress. Yeah, it's it's definitely delivering. And it's so funny because whenever I'm like bringing up these criticisms, it's like some some way I'm saying to myself, what do you want? The computer is talking to you. But the question is sort of [laughter] right. I feel silly being like, well, where's more improvement? But I think when we hear words like super intelligence, then we see the gap between where we are today and where you want to head and those questions naturally come up. And and just to go back to the power thing, I was sort of struck by Satya's comments in the podcast with Brad Gersonner where he said he has GPUs or chips that aren't plugged in yet but need need he needs warm shelves for them. so I'm curious to hear your perspective if you if we're",

Well, I think what he was referring to is that we have so much inference demand that we're power constrained on inference. , we're not power constrained, at least from the Microsoft AI perspective, on training chips and obviously my team, you know, is mostly focused on on training right now. So, obviously, Copilot is inference constrained and desperately needs more chips to scale and so does M365 and our other products. One more thing I want to talk to you about on this super intelligence push is the world model. a lot of people have talked about how these are models are trained on text and some video. I mean it's actually been amazing to watch them be able to create video that has some understanding of physics and liquids and lighting. It's not really supposed to happen that way, but it's doing it. but the there's been questions about whether models understand gravity and what happens in the real world and an LLM can't drive a car right now. So how's it going to be super intelligent? So I I am curious to hear your perspective on what's needed to or whether if it's really a priority to figure out like the physical world and if so how you get there. Yeah, that's a good question. I mean right now you know it's actually amazing as you say that models can learn from a compressed representation of reality and then produce a version of reality which looks like the thing that has been compressed from. I mean this is like text and the description text describes the physical world and the properties of the physical world. the model has never seen that and then actually is able to produce very compelling stories, code, business plans, videos and so on. so surprising that we've come so far with that structure. I'm kind of open-minded about like you know sort of robotics and streams of input from the real world. I mean, I think that you my instinct is that you can't just like crudely pile this data into existing pre-training runs because you know those runs have tokenized or they they've sort of described text data in a certain way and that you know meshing that with other like telemetry data from a robotic arm for example, you'd have to think about like at what level of abstraction to do that and obviously there's good specialist models that have become pretty good at that. but I don't think right now at least that like that is holding us",

I think that more synthetic data, more human feedback and high quality data is going to be the differentiator. Okay. So you brought up recursively self-improving AI models and maybe that is where this path towards super intelligence goes. open AI has said they want to build an automated AI researcher by 2028 and I think every lab I'm curious if this is your interest as well is just trying to build AI that improves itself. Is that realistic? I think that in some ways the RL loop is already doing that. , and at the moment there are human engineers who are in the loop who are generating data and writing evals and deciding what other data goes into training runs and running ablations on that data. , you can well imagine different parts of that stack being automated by subco components of AIS. Like it doesn't necessarily mean that one single system does it. Today we have you know RLHF the human feedback grew into RLIif where we have AI judges or AI raers to judge the quality and the usefulness of data that was also AI generated. and in many cases prompts that are used to generate diverse training data data were also AI generated. So like you know today we're at a at a point where data the core commodity which is sort of driving the progress of these models is you know albeit not completely automatically in a closed loop way at large scale you know individual parts of that pipeline have been you know developed by you know LLMs so it doesn't seem very far-fetched to say that in a few years time at significant scale or that will get closed loop and you know it'll be interesting to see on you know what happens and whether the quality bar can be maintained and whether performance does increase I think it will but it's definitely something to be very cautious about because you know a system like that could end up being very very powerful. Yeah, and I definitely want to talk to you about the downsides of it, but we had a debate on the show recently about whether that is an an ambitious thing. It even seems funny to say, but to me, that's the ultimate ambition, right? It's if you're able to do that, then you're you get into a situation where, you know, potentially you have fast takeoff of intelligence. But I guess it's hard to really imagine the and maybe my imagination isn't there the",

But I guess it's hard to really imagine the and maybe my imagination isn't there the method like discovering reasoning on their own. so talk about about both of those ambition and then whether whether I'm just my imagination is too small on this front. I mean I think the self-play work that we did at Deep Mind you know back sort of six or seven years ago now with Alpha Zero you know that that obviously paved the way to the first large scale you know sort of self-improvement effort frankly and I think everybody in the field is aware that it can be done in a certain domain where there's verifiable rewards and where you're in a kind of closed loop gaming type environment or simulated environment. , and I think people are thinking hard about how it might be possible to recreate some of the components of that , in this setting. , and you know, I I do think that's going to drive a lot of progress in the next few years. I think it's a big area that everybody's focused on. you know because fundamentally scale always ends up trumping you know you know anything else. And so if if you can have models explore the space of all possible you know sort of combinations in a computer efficient way then it may well discover reasoning by itself. may discover you know new knowledge that we hadn't even you know thought about ourselves or even like found in in in in any training data to represent that knowledge. So, but it is highly inefficient, right? I mean, learning from supervised examples with SFT and stuff like that like imitation learning is very efficient and clearly works very well because these models learn from from you know just as we've talked about an incredible amount from you know from web text which is really just a an artifact or a record of of human interaction. So but both are going to be true. I think the RL paradigm that involves more online learning from streams of experience is is also like quite promising and I think is kind of adjacent to if not orthogonal to imitation learning. So we both of those experiments will like sort of accelerate in the next few years. Now where could this go wrong? Well, I think being in the loop as a human developer adds a certain amount of friction. and that oversight is quite important, I think. you know, if a system like that had an unbounded amount of compute, it would end up being incredibly powerful. , and I think we have to sort of figure out how to force these models to communicate in a language that is",

Hacking kind of implies too much intentionality. So it's just it's it's an accidental exploit is found a path like you know to satisfying the reward or achieving the reward you know in in unintended ways and so we shouldn't anthropomorphize it. It didn't deceive us. It didn't intentionally try to hack us. It just found an exploit. And that's a problem with poor specification of the training objective and of the reward function. And so, you know, the way that we make that safer is that we get sharper in our articulation of like what is it that we're actually trying to train for? what are you know what are we trying to achieve? What are we trying to pre prevent? and then monitor like you know monitor outputs during training time rather than you know reasoning traces, chains of thought and so on rather than just at like the final stage. So a a as we grant these models more capacity to self-improve, we're going to have to change the the the framework with which that we use to kind of provide oversight to them during training. We're here with Mustafa Sullivan. He is the CEO of Microsoft AI. On the other side of this break, we are going to talk about well, it seems like there's a little bit of a strategy shift here. It's gone. Microsoft AI has gone from wanting to work on the frontier of the best models but not building them themselves to trying to build super intelligence. So why now? And what does it mean now that Microsoft AI and OpenAI have a new agreement? We will cover that right after this. And we're back here on Big Technology Podcast with Mustafa Sulleman. He's the CEO of Microsoft AI. Mustafa, is it a coincidence that Microsoft just came to this agreement with OpenAI that you could go ahead and attempt to build AGI on your own that you've now decided, hm, [clears throat] let's go ahead and start a super intelligence team or is that directly related like I think it is? No, I think it's directly related. , you know, for I think that the Microsoft Open AAI partnership is going to go down as one of the most successful partnerships in technology history for both sides. you know Satia did this deal you know at a certain time when there was a",

We'll continue to get model drops from OpenAI and and and all their IP. We'll continue to be their primary compute provider, a huge scale to the tune of, you know, billions and billions of dollars. , and also we would remove the clause in the contract that says that we couldn't build super intelligence or AGI. and that was actually expressed as a flops threshold, a flops per second threshold for a size of a certain training run. So there's a big limitation on what we were able to do. now that that is no longer there, you know, our team is reforming around this idea of humanist super intelligence. We are pursuing the absolute frontier, training omni models of all sizes, all weight classes to the absolute max capability. And over the next two or three years, you'll see us really try to build out one of the top labs in the world. I we want to train the absolute best AI models on the planet. and you know, we're we're a very young lab. We've barely been going for a year. but you know, we've got some good models on the leaderboards, text and image and audio now. And you know, over the next few years, we'll be striving to be the absolute best we can. I was just speaking with the chief technology officer of a pretty big technology company and this company has decided not to build their own large language models and it sounds a little bit wild but I think it it makes sense in a way that there's going to be obviously like to to build these models it's extremely expensive resource intensive you don't always get a payoff like we saw that with Meta and Llama. I'm not saying that's what's going to happen with you. , and maybe it makes sense just to, you know, buy off the shelf or, , use open source.

It it seems logical. , and so I'm curious like why you would disagree with your own models? I mean we we're going through a foundational platform shift you know in software from the operating system to apps from browsers search engines mobile social this is the next major platform and it's going to be bigger than all of the other platforms put together so the idea that a $3 trillion company with $300 billion of revenue and 80% of the S&P 500 on our Azure stack and M365 stack you could could depend on a third party. This it's, you know, just in perpetuity. It doesn't make sense. So, we we you know, this is a company that's been around for 50 years and navigated many of the past platform shifts incredibly well and that's the that's the journey that we're on. We have to be AI self-sufficient. There's an important mission that Satia set last year and I think that we're we're now on a path to be able to do that and so hence the formation of the super intelligence team. Exactly. So we we're we're launching the super intelligence team. we're going to be focused on you know sot at all levels but also pushing the frontier of research. I mean there are many hard problems in machine learning which you know a few months ago we weren't really focused on continual learning being one like how do we store representations of knowledge in a way that they're modifiable by different networks and they kind of accumulate knowledge over time just as humans do rather than having to retrain them from scratch. , so that's just like one of many examples of more fundamental research questions that our super intelligence team is is is now going to spend time on. Okay. Now, let's go back to the business side of it. , your episode's going to air backtoback with an episode that we'll run with Nick Kle, , the former president of global affairs at Meta. And you know, Meta, of course, they also have a super intelligence lab. And we were talking about the economics of it. And Nick's [snorts] point was very interesting. He said, \"I don't see how you can hoard super intelligence if you build it.\" , I think his idea is if Meta builds it, then Microsoft will build it and OpenAI will build it. And we've seen very like fast follows in many of these labs after they come up with a state-of-the-art model. And so the question is, will it commoditize? Will it be economically viable once two companies build it? What do you think? Well, it's definitely commoditizing. you know the cost per token has come",

Will it be economically viable once two companies build it? What do you think? Well, it's definitely commoditizing. you know the cost per token has come It's just a crazy crazy thought, right? so things are getting massively cheaper and more efficient and you know you know the top four or five models are within you know a few tiny percentage points of each other in terms of performance. But that doesn't mean that one can afford to leave that to the market and just hope that somebody open sources it. can use their open source models. , for a company of our scale, we have to be able to do that. And I think, you know, Microsoft is a platform of platforms. You know, like our API is critical. Many many people depend on it. And I think if you're a, you know, a smaller software company or a technology company of any kind, I think you can depend on the market, right, which is very different. So, Amazon, , Google, US, Anthropic, , I guess OpenAI, , are all providing, you know, APIs to the very best language models in the world. And that means that, you know, you you as a buyer, even if you're a large public company, are can feel pretty assured that for the long term, there's going to be healthy competitive forces driving down prices and improving quality for you to be able to use , you know, models via the API. Right. And so I I understand why you'd want to build it, but again, going back to this question, it's like, okay, the econ if it just doesn't seem like there won't be a price war. I mean, if if you have a couple of companies that do this. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think a price war is a great thing for consumers and for businesses. I mean, we're we're bringing down the cost of intelligence. I mean, I think that's an amazing story for humanity. the ability to access knowledge, the ability to use that knowledge to get stuff done, to write new programs, to do new scientific discovery, to get access to AI companions and emotional support. These things are going to be zero marginal cost in a decade. that's a form of abundance. That's the aspiration of society and civilization in my opinion. That's the great that's why I work on AI is to make intelligence cheap and abundant. and it will be market forces that drive down the cost of that. So I think it's pretty cool. But I I agree super cool. [laughter] And again I I don't this is this these conversations off me often put me in a place where I don't want to be which is like now I'm going to butt the idea that",

[laughter] And again I I don't this is this these conversations off me often put me in a place where I don't want to be which is like now I'm going to butt the idea that at zero cost which is again like from a business standpoint. Fair enough. How does that make sense if the marginal cost is zero? Well I mean look at it. We we're still going to you know charge you know a significant amount for it. I mean yeah we have $300 billion of revenue like I said this is a huge company providing great value but the point is where we provide value to our customers our customers will be happy to pay us for it right and that means that you know good integrations inside of M365 great models inside of you know GitHub and VS code we have co-pilot deploying on LinkedIn co-pilot in gaming our consumer product is growing from strength to strength you know we just crossed 100 million wow across all our co-pilot surfaces. So, all the products are growing great and you know there's there's there's plenty of revenue to be had in this transition. No question. Okay. Wow means week over week. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Week no weekly active user. Oh. Oh, wu. Yeah, I guess I'm used to and da but wow. Yeah. Wow. Is that why has wow become the term of art in Oh, sure. Actually, I think we're all using wow. Yeah. Yeah. No guess as to what happened. we we've been using Wow since Forever. I think it shows like a more sustained engagement. yeah. Okay. But not not not the daily wouldn't. I mean I'm sure there's Yeah. I don't know. It's always fun for me to figure out why the acronyms are the way they are. it'll remain a mystery. So you actually do list so you again you wrote about this. you list a couple forms of intelligence that you want to pursue and one of them was a personal companion or comp an AI companion for everyone. U couple questions for you to start on that one. Let me just start with one. You told me about a year ago that you think that AI will differentiate on the basis of personality. Do you still believe that? Definitely. Yeah. I mean, we we're right at the very beginning of the emergence of these very differentiated personalities because all these models are going to have great expertise. They're going to have great capabilities and they'll be able to take similar actions like you we've just said, but people like different personalities. They like different brands. They like different celebrities. They have different values. , and those things are very controllable now. , like we just released in Copilot something called Real Talk last week and it's really cool. It is truly a different",

They have different values. , and those things are very controllable now. , like we just released in Copilot something called Real Talk last week and it's really cool. It is truly a different It's more philosophical. It's sassy. It's cheeky. It's got real personality. , and the the usage is way way higher than the average , you know, session of a regular co-pilot. And it's built in a very very different way actually. , so you know, I think that's just the first foray into proper personalization and I think we'll be able to see a lot more of that coming down the pipe. Do you think it's good that people will have a new friend, if you want to call it a friend, , that they can sort of customize in the way that they want? There's been worries that, you know, people are like, what does it mean to for real friendship then? And are you going to have not normal expectations for your friends in real life? Yeah, I think it does raise the bar. , and I think we have to be cautious about that because , AIs provide high quality accurate information immediately on demand. They provide highquality emotional support increasingly. , and naturally as we get more used to that, that's going to put us under pressure as humans to provide that support to other humans and provide that knowledge to other humans and be available to them to get things done. , and I, you know, that that's going to be an interesting effect. It's going to change what it means to be human in quite a fundamental way. Like being human is going to be more about our flaws than our capabilities, right? But it also I mean thinking of the expectation it sets. I had one entrepreneur talk to me about how well there's things you would never go to a human with right now because of norms like if you're working on a project you wouldn't like go to a colleague every 5 seconds and say how about this how about this how about this or what if I tweaked it this way. but you could do that with a bot and the bot will be like oh yeah I'm happy to help you. So is there any worry that that will spill over into human relationships? what that what would that mean? I think that's a very interesting point. I mean, in some ways, , AI provide us with a safe space to be wrong. , and you know, it's kind of embarrassing, but we can ask the same question over and over again. , and in 10 different ways, and that's how we get smarter. , so I think it's a I think , yeah, it's it's it's a good philosophical question to reflect on these kind of things",

All right, Mustafa, one final question for you. , you say technologies purpose is to help advance human civilization. It should help everyone live happier, healthier lives. It should help us , invent a future where humanity and our environment truly truly prosper. , so my question for you is, has it lived up to that promise? I think science and technology has lived up to that promise. I Yeah, I think so. I think we're in an incredible place. I mean, you know, , we've doubled life expectancy in 250 years. We're curing all kinds of diseases. We can communicate with one another on these devices. , I think it's incredible. There's every reason to be optimistic about technology and and science and the project of progress. , and I I just genuinely think AIs are going to provide us all with access to abundant intelligence, which is going to make us more productive and more creative. And I think we're already starting to see it. So, yeah, I feel optimistic about that. All right, Mustafa, great to see you. Thanks so much for coming on the show. Great to see you, man. Thanks for your time. See you soon. Thank you.",
