Cache in the dunes of a server-side strand, Bury bright coins in the cloud-white sand. Cursor\u2019s a compass, caret a hook, Parrot autocomplete quoting the book. Black-flag window in dark-mode sea, The map is a prompt and the X is the key. Fold the chart\u2014context tight, Few-shot lanterns cut the night. Trim the sails, set constraints strong, Ask it true and ride the song. X marks the prompt\u2014unlock the hold, Word by word we raise the gold. Type it brave and sound the drums, Bury the cache\u2014then the treasure comes. (Yo-ho!) X marks the prompt, we call\u2014 Open the vault, let the answers fall. Yo-ho, let it roll\u2014 Map to meaning, find the gold. (sea chant) ... Let it roll. Map to meaning; find the gold. Barnacle data we scrub and we comb, Token tides rising, the gradient\u2019s foam. Regex nets catching the flotsam of noise, Patch up the hull with our toggles and toys. Bias winds shift\u2014so we tack and we trim, Fog of hallucinations\u2014keep beacons within. System-prompt captain, crew of constraints, Sailing the isle where the answer paints. Drop the temp when the squalls turn mean, Turn it up when we want to dream. Anchor in facts, check back the charts, Chain up the thought\u2014tie all the parts. X marks the prompt\u2014unlock the hold, Word by word we raise the gold. Type it brave and sound the drums, Bury the cache\u2014then the treasure comes. (Yo-ho!) X marks the prompt, we call\u2014 Open the vault, let the answers fall. If the compass spins, triangulate\u2014 Examples, citations, rules at the gate. Don\u2019t chase sirens scraping the sky, Chart the reef lines, ask better why. North is the truth, west winds the art; Guardrails glitter like stars in the dark. X marks the prompt\u2014unlock the hold, Word by word we raise the gold. Type it brave and sound the drums, Bury the cache\u2014then the treasure comes. (Yo-ho!) X marks the prompt, sing loud\u2014 Open the vault, light up the crowd. (Yo-ho!) X marks the prompt, ring true\u2014 Treasure that waits every time we cue. (sea chant) Heave\u2014ho. Fold the map. See you where the X lights up.",
