I just want everybody in the world to hear that you said I build bigger things than you do. , you do. The data centers are very enormous. It all started in 2016. I announced the world's first AI supercomput, the DGX1. The most advanced computer that anyone has ever built. It was just crickets. Crickets except for one person and it was you. That sounds like a great idea. So I built another DGX. Great. And this thing is mighty. This is the new DJX Spark. So that's the whole thing. Wow. Five times the computational power of DJX1. 40 watts, not four. Wow. DJX1 to DJX Spark. It's so fun hanging out. Thanks for having me. Welcome to base. I can't wait to see my first rocket launcher. It's just incredible.",
