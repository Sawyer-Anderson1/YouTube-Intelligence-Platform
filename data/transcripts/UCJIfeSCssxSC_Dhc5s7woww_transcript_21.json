        "text": " So there's uh on that topic of enjoyment it's it's quite interesting We should just throw this in there that there is this recent survey of about 791 professional developers Professional meaning 10 plus years of experience i That's a long time i Yeah, laughter that's a junior developer i Uh yeah in this day and age Uh so the the results here on many fronts are uh surprising So they break it down by junior and senior developers But I mean it just shows that both junior and senior developers use AI generated code in code they ship So this is not just for fun sort of intermediate kind of learning things This is code they ship And so it's 25% like most of them use around 50% or more And what's interesting is for the category of over 50% of your code that you ship is AI generated senior developers are much more likely to do so But you don't want AI to take away the thing you love i Y i I think this speaks to my experience these particular results I'm about to say So together about 80% of people find it either somewhat more enjoyable or significantly more enjoyable to use AI as part of the work i I think it depends on the task Um, for my personal usage for example I have a website where I sometimes tweak things on the website I personally don't enjoy this So, in that sense if the AI can help me to implement something on my website I'm all here for it It's it's great But then at the same time when I solve a complex problem well if there's a bug and I hunt this bug and I find the bug it's the best feeling in the world It's like you get so much joy like oh it's like you feel like great But now if you don't even think about thinking about the bug you just go directly to the LLM. Well, you never have this kind of feeling right But then there could be the middle ground where well you try yourself you can't find it you use the LLM and then you don't get frustrated because it helps you and you move on to something that you enjoy And so I think looking at these statistics I think also the difference is or what is not factored in it's averaging over all the different scenarios where we don't like so we don't know if it's for the core task or if it's for something mundane that people would not have enjoyed otherwise So in a sense AI is really great for doing mundane things that um take a lot of work Um so for example my wife the other day u she has like a podcast for like book uh like book discussions book club and she was like transferring the show notes from um Spotify to YouTube",
