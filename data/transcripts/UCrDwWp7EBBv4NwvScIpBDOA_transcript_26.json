Plus, I can show you things like maps, weather, and more in real time. Okay. Okay. Can you show me a map of the best bakeries in the Mission District? [music] Sure. Here's a map of the top bakeries in the Mission District. As you'd expect, Tartine is right up there as a favorite. Tartine. Okay. What kind of pastries do they have? [music] So, at Tartine, they've got some beloved pastries like their morning butter, which is buttery and cinnamon sweet, classic flaky croissants, rich pano chocolat, and even a fran Japan croissant filled with almond cream. Sorry, how do you pronounce that one? The fran. Yeah, no problem. It's pronounced franapan. So, kind of like fran. Okay, amazing. Thank you.",
