        "text": " In China, a humanoid robot did something humans trained for years to master music and no humanoid had ever pulled it off before In the US, another humanoid casually handed out Christmas swag and talked back A robot dog sold out in under an hour like a new smartphone. Factories started replacing skilled workers with humanoids at scale And one of the most famous robots in the world is about to step onto a global stage next months And it all starts with a robot in China doing something that looks simple until you realize it's one of the hardest things a machine has ever been asked to do music On December 22, Tar Robotics showed a humanoid robot on stage at a live event And this robot didn't lift boxes didn't stack crates didn't walk around waving at people It sat down and did hand embroidery real embroidery It threaded a needle used both hands and stitched a logo live in front of an audience Now, if you've never stitched anything in your life that might not sound impressive But the moment you think about what's actually happening there it gets kind of wild You're dealing with thread that stretches and twists fabric that moves and deforms constantly and movements that needs submission over a long sequence of steps One tiny mistake and the thread snaps the stitch misses or the whole thing falls apart This kind of task has been a nightmare for robotics for decades Industrial robots are amazing at rigid repeatable jobs Pick this metal part place it there do it again a thousand times But soft materials break everything They change shape they resist unpredictably and they require constant force adjustment in real time That's why until now long delicate twohanded work like this was seen as basically offlimits for automation And that's what made this demo so important The robot moved through the whole process smoothly staying stable the entire time with no signs of hesitation or struggle Both hands working together adjusting force tracking the needle and thread visually and staying stable the whole time That's not just motion control That's embodied intelligence working as a system People inside robotics immediately clocked what this meant Because once you can do this you're suddenly not just talking about embroidery music You're talking about wire harness assembly precision electronics fine mechanical assembly all the stuff factories still rely on skilled human hands for At the event Tar Robotics CEO Dr. Chen Yoloon explained how they got there music And the way he described it actually lines up with a bigger trend we've been seeing across AI lately He called it a data AI physics trinity approach Basically, instead of treating data collection model training and physical robots as separate worlds they connect everything into one continuous loop They collect music detailed dreamworld operational data using their SenseHub platform That data feeds into their embodied AI model the AWE 2.0 AI world",

In under a years they went from concept to live humanoid demos showing capabilities people used to say were years away Investors clearly noticed The company raised $120 million in an Angel round then followed that with another $122 music million in an Angel Plus round Now, at the time this was happening in China, a clip from the US revealed how far humanoids have come in a much more everyday setting On December 23, right before Christmas Eve, Figure AI's CEO Brett Adcock shared a short video showing him interacting with the company's latest humanoid Figure03, in a simple unscripted setting He starts by asking the robot where it was built It answers music clearly saying San Jose, California. i I was built right here in San Jose, California. i He asks which generation it belongs to The robot says it's part of the third generation i There are three generations of bigger robots and I'm the latest one i When he asks which generation is best it does the polite thing and says the third generation because it has the most advanced features I believe I'm the best as the third generation with the most advanced features i Then he tests something more practical visual recognition He asks the robot to hand him medium and large shirts The shirts are sitting in different baskets Figure 03 looks at the setup identifies the correct size each time picks the right basket and hands the shirt over correctly Under the hood this robot runs on Figure AI's Helix model which",

And honestly that early sales spike is being seen as a real validation moment It suggests that consumer grade embodied intelligence is officially something people are willing to buy at scale Now, while robot dogs were selling out online humanoids were quietly replacing people on factory floors CL, the world's largest EV battery maker launched what it says is the world's first large-scale humanoid robotpowered battery production line at its Lu Yang facility in Henan. The humanoid robot called Xiaomo is now handling critical tasks in battery pack production Xiaomma was developed by Spirit AI, a Hangju based startup founded in 2024 music and backed by CL. The robot works in end-of-line and direct current internal resistance testing which are the final checks before battery packs leave the line These tasks used to require humans to manually connect high voltage test plugs which came with safety risks and inconsistent quality Xiao uses an end-to-end vision language action model giving it strong environmental perception and precise control It handles uncertainty adjusts posture and force in real time and inserts and removes flexible wiring harnesses without damaging components In real production Xiaomo achieves over 99% connection success and matches the cycle times of skilled human workers It also monitors wiring connections continuously and reports anomalies in real time cutting defect rates During downtime it switches into inspection mode to further improve reliability CL says Xiaomo now handles continuous production across multiple battery models and delivers nearly three times the daily workload of manual labor while staying consistent and stable This fallout fits into CL's broader dominance in EV batteries From January to October, the company logged 355.2 gate hours of global installations up 36.6% year-over-year, giving it a 38.1% global market share In China alone November installations hit 40.87 await hours or 43.71% of the market And finally looking ahead to early next years one of the most iconic humanoids is about to step",

Hyundai plans to unveil its broader AI robotic strategy there positioning robotics at the center of its future growth Atlas has already been running pilot demos at Hyundai's EV plant in Georgia. Hyundai acquired Boston Dynamics in 2021 and has been steadily integrating robotics into its long-term plans The company has announced around 50 trillion roughly $ 34 billion in AI investment from 2026 to 2030 and plans to build a robot manufacturing plant in the US capable of producing 30,000 units a years For people who followed robotics for a long time Atlas represents decades of progress From early MIT leg lab experiments to modern humanoids walking into music factories and trade shows Anyway, that's where things are right now Things are moving fast and this space is getting real in a way it never has before Thanks for watching and I'll catch you in the next one",
