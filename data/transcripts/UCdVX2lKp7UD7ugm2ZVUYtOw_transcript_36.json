Every signal guiding us, every mile a sign, Moving through the daylight, your heartbeat next to mine. Switches gleam like silver in the day, Every doubt a station, we roll away. If the world goes quiet, we realign\u2014 Lean with the curve, follow the line. Keep my attention on the line, Click-clack hearts in time. Rolling forward, skies are wide, Together we arrive. You\u2019re the signal, I\u2019m the sign, Two parallel minds, Riding these lines in light\u2014 Attention on the line. On the line (on the line), Keep in time (keep in time), We design\u2014 Attention on the line. Windows glow with stories as the daylight streams, Carriages of laughter, carriages of dreams. Every ticket taken, every smile a song, We are on this journey, moving bright and strong. Safety rails beside us all the way, (Limit set, but not afraid.) Spin the dawn on rhythm and will, (Model sings what the heart can feel.) Keep my attention on the line, Click-clack hearts in time. Rolling forward, skies are wide, Together we arrive. You\u2019re the signal, I\u2019m the sign, Two parallel minds, Riding these lines in light\u2014 Attention on the line. Daylit yard, everything still, everything wide, We leave our doubts where the shadows hide. Above us the map of tomorrow shines, We are the path, we are the lines. Keep my attention on the line (don\u2019t drift, don\u2019t stray), Click-clack hearts in time (we\u2019re on our way). Read every sign, We shine into the day (arrive on time). You\u2019re the signal, I\u2019m the sign, Two parallel minds\u2014 Riding these lines in light, Attention on the line\u2026 on the line\u2026 on the line.",
