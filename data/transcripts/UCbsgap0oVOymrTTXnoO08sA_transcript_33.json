There are APIs handling expenses categories music budgets and authentication There's a database you can inspect You can see where data is stored music run queries and even download it And the entire thing was generated using around 320 credits That number is important because if you've played with earlier AI coding tools you know how quickly costs can spiral when you ask them to do anything nontrivial Here, that cost is almost negligible especially on a monthly plan And after the initial build you still have plenty of room to iterated redesign add integrations or expand features From a user's perspective it just feels like a normal well-made expense ape where everything updates as you use it budgets make sense over time and nothing feels hacked together or fake Then the same approach was applied to a fitness tracker The goal here was pretty familiar Users sign in log workouts see daily activity review statistics and track progress over time Once again Deep Agent asked a few questions to clarify expectations then built the happy The result is a mobile fitness ape where workouts can be logged in seconds music daily activity is visible immediately and history accumulates naturally over time And again this didn't burn through credits It took very little to get something functional At this point a pattern becomes obvious The complexity of the ape scales with how much you put into the prompt Keep it simple and you get something lightweight Add more detail and you get something richer The system doesn't force you into one approach Things get more interesting when the test moves away from dashboards and into interactive experiences That's where the mobile game comes in The idea was to build a match three style game something in the spirit of Candy Crush with colorful visuals and engaging mechanics This is where you'd normally expect an AI system to struggle because games involve mealtime state rules progression and feedback loops But that's not what happened because instead it paused and pushed back with the kind of questions a real game designer would ask trying to figure out whether this should be a multilevel experience how scoring should actually matter what kind of mechanics make it engaging and whether players should jump straight in or have progress saved over time Those answers shaped the entire structure of the happy Once they were provided the system built a playable game What came out as a functioning match three game with levels special mechanics score",

I want to see those ideas in the comments Now, all of this ties directly into another major capability Deep Agent also introduced recently music which is argentic workflows. Automation is going through the same kind of shift that ape development is going through Traditional automation tools force music you to define every step manually If something changes the workflow breaks and you're back fixing logic This AI actually music flips that dynamic and instead of wiring every step you describe the outcome you want The system figures out how to get there builds the workflow, runs it monitors it and adapts when inputs change And this really matters because the moment automation starts touching real work it has to exist inside some structure where you can see what happened control how things move forward connect it to other systems and actually hold it accountable Otherwise, chiton setups collapse quickly and rigid workflows snap as soon as things get messy Deep agent combines both The model reasons through ambiguity and the workflow enforces structure This works especially well for things like invoice processing where formats change constantly and rigid parsers fail It also works for lead enrichment outreach customer support reporting pipelines and content quality control In all of these cases you want intelligence making decisions while a structured system ensures consistency and traceability What makes this powerful is that workflows don't exist in isolation They live in the same environment where you reason about",
