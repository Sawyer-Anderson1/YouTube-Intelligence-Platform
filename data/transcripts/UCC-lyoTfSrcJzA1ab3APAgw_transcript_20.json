This week alone, a humanoid in China just walked 66 mi straight through real streets, setting a Guinness World Record. At the same time, Figure is caught in controversy after a whistleblower claimed their robots are strong enough to deliver impact forces that could crack a human skull, raising the most serious safety questions the industry has seen so far. Xpang finally revealed the official price of their female iron robot, and it's shaking the entire humanoid market. A brand new startup, Fibbot, unveiled what people are already calling an Atlas killer. Yeah, this week was wild. Hey guys, Alfie here. Welcome back to AI Nexus. Every week, the robot world levels up, and this one felt like the future jumped forward again. Meanwhile, in China, a humanoid robot just set a Guinness World Record by walking for over 3 days straight, covering 106 km, the longest journey ever recorded for a humanoid machine. This wasn't a treadmill test or a lab demo. It was a real trekk from Sujo to Shanghai through unpredictable streets, crowds, and traffic. And that robot was the Agibot A2. The Agibot A2 walked 106 km from Sujo to Shanghai. That's 66 mi through actual city streets with traffic, pedestrians, uneven pavement, and everything else that makes urban navigation complicated for anything without a human brain. Most robot demonstrations happen in warehouses or labs where every variable gets controlled. The A2 walked through the same environment you'd experience on a regular commute. Traffic lights that change unpredictably. Crowds moving in random directions. Tile roads, ramps, surface transitions. The kind of chaos that breaks most autonomous systems within minutes. The robot handled all of it for 106 km straight. But the detail that matters most. Aubot claims they've delivered over 1,000 of these robots. This wasn't a custom prototype that a team of engineers babyed through every step. According to the company, any A2 unit rolling off their production line could attempt this same journey. That claim suggests a level of manufacturing consistency and reliability that most robotics companies can't back up with receipts. Think about the failure modes that didn't happen. The robot could have misread signals and walked into traffic. It could have lost balance on uneven surfaces. Navigation could have failed. Power management could have collapsed before reaching the next charging point. None of that occurred over a multi-day journey through two major cities. And if you think a 106 km walk is intense, wait until you see what Figures Robots endured inside BMW's factory. Figures Robots just finished an 11-month deployment at BMW's South Carolina factory. And honestly, they look like they've been through hell. We're talking scratches everywhere. Factory grime coating every surface, dents and scuffs across their entire bodies. And you know what? That's exactly what Figure wanted to show us. This wasn't some polished demo where everything works perfectly under controlled conditions. These",

And you know what? That's exactly what Figure wanted to show us. This wasn't some polished demo where everything works perfectly under controlled conditions. These real production, real problems. Over those 11 months, these machines helped build more than 30,000 BMW X3 vehicles and loaded over 90,000 sheet metal parts. Their job sounds straightforward. Grab parts from bins, placed them on welding fixtures with millimeter precision. But here's the thing, they did this every single working day for nearly a year. We're talking 10-hour shifts, 5 days a week. Within 6 months of launching Figure02, they had robots on BMW's floor being tested. By month 10, they were running full shifts on an active assembly line. But here's the crazy part. The robots weren't perfect. The forearm became the main failure point. Why? Because cramming 3\u00b0 of freedom, cooling systems, and all those cables into a humansized forearm created serious problems. The constant motion stressed the microcontrollerbased circuit board and all that wiring going to the wrist. Thermal issues, dexterity requirements, tight packaging, all of it added up. What makes Figure different is their brutally honest about these failures. For figure 03, they completely redesign the wrist electronics. They eliminated the distribution board and all that problematic dynamic cabling. Now each motor controller talks directly to the main computer. Less complexity, fewer failure points. CEO Brett Adcock called those battle scars proof of real deployment. And he's right. Those beaten up robots proved humanoid machines can survive actual factory conditions month after month, not just look pretty in promotional videos. And just as Figure exposes its battle scars, Xpang drops a shock that hits the whole robot market like a meteor. Xpang has finally revealed the price of their female iron robot. announced live at the Guanghou Auto Show. Yes, the same iron that went viral at Xpang's AI day when people genuinely thought a human might be inside the suit. But now we know what this robot actually costs. Right now, most humanoids cost as much as supercars, $200 to $300,000, and some go past half a million. So, Xping starting iron at 150,000 instantly undercut nearly every competitor. But the real shock came when Hesh Xiao Pong said the mass production price could drop to around $45,000. That's the first time a humanoid robot has sounded anywhere close to consumer possible. And then there's Tesla. Elon Musk keeps saying Optimus Gen 3 might eventually fall below $25,000, almost half of Xping's projected cost. That means the world's first humanoid price war has officially started. Xpang aiming for 40 to 50,000. Tesla targeting 25. Everyone else stuck above 150,000. It's no longer just about movement. It's about who can build an affordable robot for everyday life. Hiao Pong explained the pricing logic, too. Over half of Iron's value comes from software. Cars",

It's about who can build an affordable robot for everyday life. Hiao Pong explained the pricing logic, too. Over half of Iron's value comes from software. Cars mostly materials. But with Iron, the intelligence is what you're paying for. And because Xping already poured billions into self-driving tech, they're reusing that entire software stack for iron. One investment powering two industries. Smart move. He also said something bold. Iron could be more valuable than a car because cars only transport you. While a humanoid can assist at home, at work, and in public spaces, it becomes a platform, not just a product. Xpang claims mass production will begin by late 2026 and they're already testing real iron units inside their Guanghou factory. Robots lifting objects, repeating tasks, and working beside humans. This isn't concept art. It's happening now. Iron is built for level three autonomy, meaning it can move and work with minimal supervision. Xping's vision language action system lets it see, understand instructions, and act all in one loop. And just like Xpang cars get OTAA updates, Iron will learn new skills through software. Your robot could literally improve overnight. One more detail, the robot shown at AI day was version 7. The version shipping in 2026 will be version 8. Xping admitted the hands still wear out too fast, lasting only about a month in factory tests. But the company's confidence in a 2026 launch shows the core robot is solid. They just need stronger hands. If humanoid robots really drop to $4 to $50,000, do you think normal households will actually buy them? Let me know in the comment. If Xang is changing the price game, Pebbot is changing the performance game. A Chinese startup just went head-to-head with Boston Dynamics, and they did it with a backflip. Fibbit's new M1 humanoid didn't just land a clean flip, it landed a human-like one. And here's why that matters way more than it sounds. This company was founded in September 2024. Two Tin Hua University roommates, Ren Xiao Yu and Mao Shu Han, went from engineering students to building a backflipping humanoid in barely 12 months. That kind of speed is unheard of in robotics. Now, back flips aren't new. Boston Dynamics Atlas has been doing them for years using heavy hydraulics. Unit's H1 pulled off the world's first standing backflip without hydraulics in March 2024. Engine AI and Unitry have even done front flips and side flips this year. So, what's different? Fibbot claims the M1's flip looks more natural, almost human in its movement. You can debate that, but you can't deny how fast the bar is rising. Here's the real shocker. The M1 costs under $42,000. Atlas over a million. We've officially reached the point where you can buy a humanoid robot for less than a mid-range",

We've officially reached the point where you can buy a humanoid robot for less than a mid-range open-source frameworks or borrowed designs. Everything is developed inhouse. A fully vertical approach similar to Tesla's. That's harder, riskier, and more expensive. But it means total control, faster iteration, and no easy reverse engineering for competitors. But let's answer the big question. Why do companies keep showing back flips if no one needs a robot gymnast? Two-word answer: stress test. A robot capable of a backflip has dynamic balance, explosive power, real-time sensing, and precise control. Those same skills translate to real work. Carrying loads, navigating homes, assisting the elderly. Fibbit's backflip isn't a revolution. It's a confirmation. A new player can now reach worldclass capability in one year and at a price regular people can actually imagine paying. The question isn't whether robots can backflip anymore. It's how soon one will be useful enough that you'll want one in your house. And just when you think robotics can't get any more extreme, Unitry shows up with a basketball playing humanoid. If you enjoyed this breakdown, hit subscribe so you never miss the next big robot reveal. The Unit G1 is now shooting baskets, not holding a ball and dropping it. Actually taking shots with form that looks eerily similar to professional players. The videos show this robot executing LeBron's single leg silencer celebration and Kobe's fadeaway jump shot. Those aren't party tricks. They're movements that require your entire body to work as one coordinated system. Here's what makes this genuinely unsettling. Running and jumping. The G1 already did that. Flips and martial arts sequences. Old news. But basketball forces the robot to do something fundamentally different. You're gripping an object without destroying it. Calculating trajectory while your body's in motion. identifying a target and adjusting your position relative to something that's 10 ft away. All of this happening at the same time, not in isolated sequences. Carnegie Melon and Nvidia built something called the ASAP framework to make this work. They captured actual movement data from professional basketball players, real athletes performing real attempts, and converted those motions into something the robot could understand and replicate. The framework trains the robot in simulation first, then collects real world performance data to fix the gap between what works in a computer and what works on an actual court. The robot learns through repetition and error correction. Take a shot, miss, adjust, put another one up, refine again, the same way humans practice, just with computational precision backing every iteration. But here's where this gets wild. The G1 costs $16,000, not six figures, not some astronomical research budget number. 16 grand puts this robot within reach of universities, small research teams, even well-funded hobbyists. When advanced robotics stops",

The G1 costs $16,000, not six figures, not some astronomical research budget number. 16 grand puts this robot within reach of universities, small research teams, even well-funded hobbyists. When advanced robotics stops institutions, development accelerates in ways nobody can predict. Now, reality check. The G1 fell during a demonstration in July 2025. Balance during dynamic movements remains a genuine problem. And Carnegie Melon and Nvidia haven't released detailed shooting accuracy statistics yet, which probably means the numbers aren't impressive right now. But not every breakthrough looks flashy. Some look downright ordinary until you realize how hard they actually mented one of their strongest realworld demos yet. And this time, it's not a highlight reel or a staged moment. It's a full warehouse workflow completed from start to finish by two V3 humanoid robots working completely on their own. The demo begins with both robots scanning the entire space. Their sensors map shelves, boxes, and walking paths in real time. No markers, no preset routes. They simply understand the environment as it is. And when something looks different from before, they don't freeze or pause. They instantly rebuild their plan. The same way a human worker adjusts when the aisle is crowded. Once a robot locates the right package, its vision system becomes surprisingly detailed. It checks the label, the edges, the angle, and even the size before confirming. If the match isn't perfect, the robot leans in or shifts position to doublech checkck. A small behavior that feels shockingly close to human judgment. Manipulation is where V3 really stands out. The fingers use dynamic force control, tightening if the box slips and softening if it seems fragile. The wrist and elbow stay stable, almost like an industrial robotic arm disguised inside a humanoid frame. As the robot walks, its feet make constant micro adjustments to stay balanced, even when carrying weight. But the most impressive part is that the entire sequence is uncut. It's a full 18-minute run. Two robots, 32 boxes, eight piles, and four flow racks. All without teley operation. They avoid each other naturally, pick from different heights, and work at a steady, consistent pace. For the first time, Mentybot doesn't look like a lab experiment. It looks like an actual warehouse worker, reliable, autonomous, and ready for real logistics work. If robots can already handle warehouse tasks end to end, which industry do you think gets automated next? Let me know in the comments. And just as Ment shows what reliable deployment looks like, figure gets hit with accusations that raise real safety questions. Figure officially retired Figure02 earlier this year. But while the engineering improved, the company walked straight into something far more serious. A federal lawsuit. Just months after hitting a $39 billion valuation fueled by investments from Jeff Bezos, Nvidia, and Microsoft, Figure was sued by its former head of product safety, Robert",

        "text": "retired Figure02 earlier this year. But while the engineering improved, the company walked straight into something far more serious. A federal lawsuit. Just months after hitting a $39 billion valuation fueled by investments from Jeff Bezos, Nvidia, and Microsoft, Figure was sued by its former head of product safety, Robert Gruendell says the robots are strong enough to fracture a human skull. In one malfunction, a robot sliced a/4in gash into a steel refrigerator door. If it can carve into steel, what happens if a person gets hit? According to him, impact tests showed forces 20 times higher than the human pain threshold and more than double what's needed to crack an adult skull. Even worse, Grundel claims that when he joined Figure, the company had no formal safety procedures, no incident tracking, no risk assessments, nothing. He says a safety plan was created to impress investors, then gutted right after funding closed. When he raised concerns, he was fired and told it was due to poor performance. Figure denies every accusation, calling the lawsuit baseless. But the questions linger with Figure predicting more than 200,000 humanoid robots in factories and homes by 2029. People are now asking the one question that matters. Are these machines actually safe to live and work around? What a week for humanoid robots? From world record street walks to factory battle scars, from price wars shaking the market to back flips, basketball shots, and even federal lawsuits, this industry is moving faster than anyone expected. And the crazy part, this is still the early stage. Every week, the breakthroughs get bigger, the risks get realer, and the future gets closer. Whether it's X paying slashing prices, figure rebuilding hardware under pressure, unit pushing sports, or Fibbot proving a new robot can hit worldclass levels in just one year.
