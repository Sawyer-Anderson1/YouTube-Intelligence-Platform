And it turns out Wikipedia actually maintains a highly detailed list of all of these AI smells when it's doing writing for you. And so someone took that page and turned it into a prompt that you can give your AI, so it no longer has that. You can prompt with this list of AI smells, and it basically won't do that anymore. You can also add this directly into the personalization or the system message of your favorite AI.",
