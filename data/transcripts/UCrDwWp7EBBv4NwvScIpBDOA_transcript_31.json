We've been users of Open AI Chat GPT for the last couple of years. we have deployed the the product to actually initially 3,000 employees across many different countries and then very quickly we jumped to 11,000. We're very proud of what we have there. We have a 83% weekly recurrence in our in our people saving around 3 hours average per employee and we are measuring efficiencies of around 80% in many cases. We have deployed more than 20,000 GPS in the organization and 4,000 of them are being used on a daily basis by hundreds and thousands of employees. We gave a specific training for 250 leaders including CEO and chairman. So they really learn hands-on how to use Chad GPT on a journey that was built for themselves. Our executive committee is mostly composed of very heavy users of of Chad UBT. So we see members of the executive committee that jump into a session with the teams full of ideas on what is it that they can do. You're serving hundreds of millions of users all over the world, a lot of companies. And then I feel really I feel that you are there every day for us.",
