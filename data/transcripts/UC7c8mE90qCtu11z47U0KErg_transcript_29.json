India comes with the level two where he allows us to buy some GPUs but not as many as we want and then level one can buy how many ever they want. Donald Trump doesn't want these countries to build AI capabilities as good as a US capabilities. GPUs are the engine for these AI models to get trained on. So without GPUs there is no AI. So that is the hardware part of it. Expensive countries have to rely on countries like China, India and everywhere else is because the cost of human labor is so high there. Now with AI coming into the picture, whoever controls this technology can control the whole supply chain to a point where you can build autonomous factories.",
