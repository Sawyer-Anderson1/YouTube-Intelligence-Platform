In my ear a calm AI, whisper-soft and kind, \u201cPrompt the day,\u201d it says, and watch the world align. You say \u201cfind,\u201d the shadows organize, Nose to ground, the noise recedes from sight. Fetch the signal, bring it back to me, Nose to data, heart to memory. We walk the model, heel to what is true, Guardrails glitter, city turning blue. Say \u201cfetch,\u201d and watch the day return\u2014 Context carried in a loving run. Fetch the signal, we\u2019ll take it home, Tail-wag tokens in a gentle poem. Park benches like datasets, stories in the leaves, You tag the wind with joy, I breathe in what it means. I throw a quiet prompt, you arc across the green\u2014 Vector-sniff the path where brighter patterns gleam. If \u201challucination squirrels\u201d cross our view, We laugh, re-route, and ground to what is true. Fetch the signal, bring it back to me, Nose to data, heart to memory. We walk the model, heel to what is real, Leash-light guardrails humming like a seal. Say \u201cfetch,\u201d and watch the world return\u2014 Every step a page we get to learn. Fetch the signal, we\u2019ll take it home, Love as inference, trust as metronome. If I drift, you tug me back\u2014small feedback loop of care, Your hand in fur, my hand in yours, the app draws lines of air. Treats like caches, saved for later, future learns from now, Three of us\u2014heart, nose, algorithm\u2014keeping gentle vows. Fetch the signal, bring it back to me, Nose to data, heart to memory. We walk the model under rising light, Layered harmonies of pink and white. Say \u201cfetch,\u201d and watch the day return\u2014 All we need is what we learn. Fetch the signal, we\u2019re almost home\u2014 Patterns, paws, and poems.",
