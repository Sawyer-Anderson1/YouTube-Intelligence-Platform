        "text": " And we're live. Hi everyone. Welcome back to OpenAI Build Hours. I'm Christine. I'm on the startup marketing team and I'm here today with Corey on our developer experience team. Thanks Christine. Nice to see everybody. I particularly work on chat apps but broadly on our developer experience team across OpenAI's developer platform and tooling. So our first topic for this year is apps in Chat GBT. this is our first build hour of the year and I'm actually really excited that we have students from Berkeley, Stanford, MIT joining us today for the first time. so build hours if you're not familiar is to really empower you with the best practices, tools, and AI expertise to scale your company using OpenAI APIs and models. Right below on your screen, there's a link where you can check out our homepage. You can watch past build hours on demand as well as sign up for all upcoming ones. So today, here's a brief snapshot of what you can expect. So first, we're going to do an overview on the apps platform. So this is going to be what we launched, real use cases. We're actually going to go into chat GPT and show you the apps that you can use right now. And then we'll dive into building an app, the entire process, and also how to use codecs and our newly launched Docs MCP server to do this. And of course the demo. We always live build during build hours. And today we'll be creating an app in Chachi BT to play ping pong. We did practice beforehand playing ping pong. So we are definitely ready. and then Corey will walk you through some best practices on how to make your app even better. so this includes UIUX guidelines and what makes an app actually valuable and then additional resources so that you can build an app and submit it to be reviewed to be able to be live in TATBT. And then last is Q&A. We reserve 10 minutes for this. during the session, you can actually go into the right side of your screen if you click over to the Q&A button. feel free to submit your questions, comments. Our team is in the room right here in SF as well as New York and we'll answer them throughout the session. Then we will pick a few to answer live. so with that, let's dive right in. Thanks Christine. well, hey everybody. good morning, good afternoon, good evening from wherever you may be joining. I'm really excited today chat talk about Chad PD apps particularly the apps platform and show you how to build. I know we have a variety of folks here watching today. So we have both people for the first time looking at chatb apps and I know there's a lot of seasoned developers out there who've been messaging me before the live stream. So hopefully this is helpful for both net new builders and",

So we have both people for the first time looking at chatb apps and I know there's a lot of seasoned developers out there who've been messaging me before the live stream. So hopefully this is helpful for both net new builders and so let's kick off and move over to the next slide. Great. And just to cover what we've launched since dev day when chatb apps as a platform launched we launched our apps SDK everything from the framework and how chatbt injects a UI widget within the client to how we are able to use MCP servers to pull in different contexts and tools and actions to take actions on behalf of the user's intent. And as well we launched our apps doc site within developers.ai.com open.com for everybody to learn about all the different components pieces for you to build your experiences that you'd like. And as well, we've recently launched our public app submission flow as K Christine mentioned. you have the opportunity to put your own experience within JPT for people all over the world to use. And as well, we have an app marketplace for you to discover more apps and install them into JPT. And the last but last but not least, we have a bunch of different resources we've shipped across our UI component library which helps give you already styled assets for you to make your app that look and feel very succinct with the rest of JPT. And we have an app sample repo please check those out. And last but not least, what I'm excited to show you today is our new Docs MCP server to get you building even faster. All right. so we're going to move into a demo of SM apps to begin. I'm just going to show what apps actually look like within CHBT and then we'll move on to actually creating an app. All right. So now it's my turn to share. I'm going to go to my screen. Okay. I am actually going to go over here and tab over really quickly. Cool. So here we are in CHBT and I've preloaded the All Trails app. You can go into the plus button and then add more apps there directly or go to our app directory to look for different apps that you would like to install. And you know this weekend I'd love to go hiking. So let's ask All Trails app to help me do that. I'd like to go hiking in Marin. Please help me find some great trails. Hide this. Okay. So while this is happening the model is in taking in my intent and then passing that context off to all all trails MCP app and it's providing back a list of data that you know is in the all trails platform. So that's really what's powerful about apps. You can pull in different contextual data that doesn't exist potentially",

So that's really what's powerful about apps. You can pull in different contextual data that doesn't exist potentially directly access. All Trials has a lot of great reviews on their site for that type of information and it's presented this UI layer for me to see you know where they are in the world. but I'd love to do something even more powerful here and refine that experience by asking it to do something and find me dog friendly trails. Please find me dog friendly trails in marine. And at this point the model now is doing some refinement with the all trails app. And here we go. It's filtered some great dog friendly options. And that is a capability from the app directly that you can provide to create a more engaging and immersive experience that uses the power of the model. the engagement experience from a UI and as well some logic and data that's been brought in from all trails. as well they have the capability of doing full screen mode. So these are some great widget capabilities that we've exposed for you to control the experience within chatbt. So let's move on to the next app. So if you haven't seen the Adobe Express app, we're going to load that one here. And you can do some interesting visual creation directly now in chatbt. So you can say build me a flyer for a builder event here in San Francisco on January 24th. and let's make it outdoor clothing theme. Keeping up with our hiking adventure for this weekend. So, while that happens, you know, a lot of things are being kicked off. the Adobe Express app MC MCP server is being called. some logic is being passed in for some creation. It's going to be surfacing me different templates right now to pick the style and feel of my flyer that it's being generated here. I like the this one. This one's Let's choose this one. And then at this point, I can decide if I like it. And I actually can fill in the context from above. So I'll just say fill text with the event details. And at that point, you can take the context that you've supplied above from your first prompt and inject that directly into the event template that we chose. Great. So, so here are some options that it has chosen. , and you can go and edit this further for your builder's event. , you can also see this , and personalize this directly. , but what we're going to do is just jump ahead to the next app. I'm going to show you now quizzes. So, , quizzes is an app that we built at OpenAI for anybody to build their",

So, , quizzes is an app that we built at OpenAI for anybody to build their know, learn more information. So, I love coffee. So, let's build a quizzes app that tests my knowledge of how to make a great espresso. So, one thing interesting about the quizzes app is all the content in this UI here is dynamically rendered. , and we did that by creating just the structured output within your tool response so that the UI knows how to exactly render out the content based off of the context provided in. , so all all of the generation here is only done dynamically and nothing needs to be necessarily stored in the back end. So that's one paradigm you could add into your app if you want to have dynamic content. It's taking a second to generate a quiz. Let's give it a second. All right. For a balanced espresso on many modern machines, what brew ratio is a common starting point? Christine, do you know? I will guess a 1:4 ratio. All right. Let's see if that is. Unfortunately, it was 1 to2. Okay. What is a typical target brew temperature range for brew for espresso? I actually don't know this. It might be 98 to 105, 110 to 120, 80 96. Okay. Well, there you go. You can use the quizzes app to basically build any type of information that you would love to be tested on and come back to the same chat history and and redo those for learning. So yeah, these are just some fun experiences to show you what you can build within HPT. but let's actually go take a look now at the next piece of content. So, I'm gonna stop sharing my screen and we're back. Okay. Thanks for walking us through all of these apps in ChachiBT. Feel free to try this yourself if you're watching and play around with it. Great. So, we looked at some apps what we've launched and how they work in chatbt. I'm going to just spend one to two minutes on the app construct of what is an app in CHBT and then we'll move in to start building some apps ourselves. so for folks watching if you're not already familiar with MCP as a concept MCP provides capabilities across tools, actions and resources that enable you know AI clients to have different actions and knowledge being brought in and taking actions on behalf user both in read write capabilities. And so if a user asks chat tovt you know for example like find me trails you can use the alltra trail app talk to your MCP server which could do anything from pulling in data from a backend to generating some information on the",

And so if a user asks chat tovt you know for example like find me trails you can use the alltra trail app talk to your MCP server which could do anything from pulling in data from a backend to generating some information on the URI in the tool output for chatb to to render out a web component. The web component is optional. So you could just have a backend only chatbt app but what I think is most powerful is combining both the model data logic from MCP server and also a web component that is you know interactive within chatbt. So the web component gets loaded within chatbt and it has access to the windowopenai capability API that is allowing you as a developer to do things within chatbt that provide an immersive experience. we can tab two two tabs over , here we go. So, one of the things I wanted to call out is the framework here that we built and works within CHPT is an open protocol. Anybody can have an MCP server and also use the same framework of injecting a widget runtime within an AI client to have a UI on top of an MCP server. And just to dive a little bit deeper on the actual web component, we've exposed the window. OpenAI API which allows you as a developer to have your widget template call this API and do a bunch of different things from reacting to context updating state receiving the tool results to you know take some action or call the tools directly to do some other operation. yes so I'm going to spend a few more minutes now just talking about what those capabilities are and then we'll keep keep it moving. , if you're not familiar already, , there's the ability to do full screen mode like we mentioned. And as well, you can add in, , anything you want really in the UI that meets our, , app submission guidelines and policies. And, , rendering and map view is one of those examples that creates a really immersive experience. And we have a UI component library that we'll share , after this live stream and also in the chat. Some of the display mode options that you have is you can just load the widget in line. That's the most common experience. So that in flow as a user continues to talk with the model it's brought in to provide additional enhancement to the experience. You do picture and picture which is quite interesting to always leave up some type of floating window as a user continues to engage and as well full screen as I mentioned. Awesome. So, I think it's time to actually go through the process of building an app. , let's actually run through the process of how to build an app. , and then we'll show you how to use codeex afterwards.",

So, I think it's time to actually go through the process of building an app. , let's actually run through the process of how to build an app. , and then we'll show you how to use codeex afterwards. as a developer to everybody listening and kind of walk through what it means to build a chatbt app. This is the process that exists today for most developers and the traditional way of building apps. You may read the docs and learn a lot about you know a content an API an SDK our quick start for example. You then may go into GitHub and then download some code and actually see some examples as well. You may then go reference a component library that we shipped which is really helpful for people to get going quickly and use things that are styled already. And then you may start coding in your repo and just start hacking away, downloading the samples, editing them and you have to remember all these steps that iterative process of understanding the concepts looking at the components going in the repo and you code for days and this has been the traditional form of software development for a long time now which we're all familiar with and then you also have to fix deployment and and u manage your application and the runtime of that nature. This is great, but I think we have the opportunity as well to look at the build app process using codecs and our docs MTP server to help you build that much faster in an AI first world. So I still recommend everybody to go build the traditional way, read, download sample code and and ingest information, but as well if you want to get going quicker and also have a really smart, thoughtful partner to work with you and code pair, Codex has a great tool here to help you build a lot faster. So at this point we have one more slide. just want to quickly highlight that we have our docs MCP server. , as I mentioned earlier, MCP enables AI clients to have additional information and context and take actions on behalf. What our docs MCP server does is you can load this into codeex directly and it has all that context on how to build an open AI in an AI enabled way for the model to understand you know how to hit our API or scaffold out code and things of that nature. , so our MTP server is is based on all of OpenAI's content. So you could build our API our apps SDK and and more. But today we'll just focus on how you can use it to build a chat app. Cool. I will switch over to you so you can show how to do this. Thank you. so if you're not familiar with Codeex",

Thank you. so if you're not familiar with Codeex You can go to OpenAI developers site and go over to Codex and go over to the overview. And this is how you install it. It's just an npm install command. So, we're going to do that right now. And here I am in the terminal and I'm going to install Codex. I already have Codex installed so it would scaffold out, you know, a little bit more packages. But there you go. I've installed Codex. Next up, we're going to add our MCP server for the OpenA developer docs. We are in the openi developer site again under resources and that's where we have our link for docs mcp again you can use this with codec you can use with z code you can use this in cursor our docs mcp server are here to help you build irrespective of the platform you use for ani coding tool so let's copy that and let's go into our terminal again I'm going to clear the window I'm going to paste that command and codeex mcp add open developer docs and here's the URL Great. We've added our global MTP server. Now, anytime I talk to Codeex, I have this information ready to go. , so what I'm going to do now is also copy over a agents MD file into this folder. So now all I have is this agent MD file. And all this agents MD file is going to do is say always use the open A developer documentation MC server if you need to work on anything with open API chats FDK etc etc and that just provides codeex the context it needs to always know to use open I developer docs all right so we've installed codeex we've installed the docs and p server let's go going and just scaffold out some code so I'm going to initiate codeex by just saying codeex and the very first time you're running codeex in any repository or workspace, you have to enable or allow it to take actions on your behalf or you can require approval. I'm going to just allow it. Great. And here we are within codeex. you're welcome to choose the model you want to run. I use GPT 5.2 Codeex and as well I stick with the default medium reasoning level, but you can throttle those up and down as you please. great. So let's go ahead and ask Codeex to build me a ping pong app. As you saw, there's nothing in my repo except the agents of D file. , create me a chatbt app with a simple UI and MCP server to play a pingpong",

So let's go ahead and ask Codeex to build me a ping pong app. As you saw, there's nothing in my repo except the agents of D file. , create me a chatbt app with a simple UI and MCP server to play a pingpong cursor to control a paddle that I can play against the computer. So I just came up with this right now and this is the command I'm going to give Codeex and at this point CEX is going to take some time to you know take on this task. It's going to inspect the current repository which is nothing is in it and then at that point understand from the agent MD instructions that it should probably use our open AI docs MCP server to start ingesting this information. As you can see here it's understand that context and it the first thing it did already is now calling a developer docs MCP server looking for the chats apps SDK quick start which will help it scaffold out code and actually start building out a repo for me. And as it's building as it's building this out, you can actually see what docs it's referencing. Exactly. So it's looking at the quick start and it's going to be going forth and looking at the MCP server files, etc., etc. Now, this is the process you may already do in your current developer flow by reading the docs, looking at, you know, quick starts and then going from there. but you can let a lot let a lot of that initial scaffolding be driven through codeex. , so while this runs in the background, it will take a couple minutes here to kind of build out my initial game. I will go back to the docs here and just quickly show you some components here within the docs that it may be looking at. So the quick start itself for your own level of learning has everything you need to build a very simple app. shows you a simple HTML file and as well a a basic MCP server. In this case, this example is using the node MCP server package to to start building out your own MCP server. And it has a simple tool register here and as well the resources that it responds with and how to run that server. So this is what the codeex MCP server right now is ingesting and building. All right, we did have a question. someone did ask if you have an example hello world web component and they're struggling most with packaging. So is that something that we can help with using codecs? Yeah. that's a great question. So two things that I think that will address that. One is take a look at our quick start. This is essentially the hello world. We also have full example repos in the GitHub that I will link at the",

This is essentially the hello world. We also have full example repos in the GitHub that I will link at the just getting started, you can run both a web component and your MCP server to build a very simple hello world app. And what I've shown today and the task has just finished is you can ask Codeex to actually just scaffold out a hello world for you if you don't want to download it yourself and and take on those initial steps. Okay, great. So let's look at what Codex did here. It built a minimal CHPd app with a ping pong web component and MCP server. I can you know look at my repo here and see what's in here. So we have agents MC that I already created package JSON public where my HTML is and the server that's there. let's actually just run this MCP server. So I'm going to go into this other tab. You can see here these are the files that it was created. I'm going to mpm install the packages. And now I'm going to mpm start and run this server. What was Oops, sorry. I already have a server running in the background. why don't we I can either change my server here like let me do it on the fly. Can you update server from local host 8787 to 8000? This is a good live debugging. , I already have a port running in the background. So, , without me jumping over there and killing that, I can just tell Codex to update my server. It's great. So, let's go back here in this window and let's rerun that. So, I can do mpm start. Oh, I need to reinstall. Okay. Great. Well, what I'm going to do is actually just turn off the other server really quick. All right. All right. Let's go back to screen share. Okay, cool. I have my server running right here and I am going to now tunnel the local host at 8787 to this endpoint. And now we can go into chatubt here and add this app to chatbt. Let's go into settings and go into apps. Let's go into create app and call this ping pong build hour. and add this MCP server. I'm going to add in /mcp because you need to reference the actual MCP server running on my enrock tunnel. I'm going to go to no off and I'm going to allow this app. Let's create the app. All right, let's add this app now into chatbt ping pong bug hour and say start match. All right.

And I Oh, looks like I have to drag my paddle, which is kind of fun. , against the computer right now. , I was able to generate the code to scaffold out a very basic ping pong app, which is really fun. But what would be even more fun is to have multiplayer AI insights where the model can give me information and do this in real time where I can play with a friend who also is on chat like Christine. Okay, I'm ready. So this is a simple app that we generated with Codeex. Sorry, go here. We're running an Enro tunnel to tunnel for our MCP server and codeex just scaffolded out of the code. So I can take a look at that right here. You can see this is the code that's running. But what I'm going to do now is turn off this server and go into let me and we will show you a app that I've built in full screen. Okay, so we're doing this live, folks, so bear with me. Okay, so I am now going into here. And this is a ping pong app that I've spent a few more days working on or a few more hours using codecs. And I'm going to start this server. Actually do need to turn off the old server, which I did. And then go and create a new tunnel. Oop, the tunnels are actually already live. So, at this point now, I should be able to go here. And I've spent, , a few more hours adding in capabilities like scores, , a lobby, and also, , the ability to do multiplayer. , let's do this live, and if it doesn't work, I will debug and get it working. But we're going to do a new match. So, I'm gonna ask it for a new match. And at this point, , Christine, you can do this as well. You're going to do new match. So, Christine's screen is on the right. Mine is on the left. We've are running my MCP server and the ping pong app that I spent a few more hours working on. And so this is an example of where you could take like an app and I'm going to do create match. And you're going to take this code. Okay. C6 C2 E9. And you're going to join match. And when she hits join match, the game should move right away. So I'm only moving my left screen here. You can see my mouse and Christine is playing on the right. Oh, already scored one point. Okay. I have to we're gonna play a full game here because we I spent a few hours building this and we want to let everybody see",

I have to we're gonna play a full game here because we I spent a few hours building this and we want to let everybody see the first ever real time multiplayer app ever in HBT or at least the one I've seen and that's a lot of fun. You can create an experience that is both a game or you can imagine this being done for something more in a in a business workflow like a live editor or things of that nature. But a game is a really fun example. you could play with your friends. And I'm going to let Christine score a few points here cuz she's actually really good at ping pong. We played and she did beat me definitely. So, boom. She's going to score. And we're going to we're going to get to seven points. So, right now, I'm just letting the ball go through. But, let's rally one more time and then I will miss this next shot. Boom. Okay, we're going to get to seven. And now game's over. I lose because screen Christine screen says she wins which is really fun. but what's even better and why this is powerful to do within chatbt is you have the access of the model right there. I've additionally exposed a separate tool call for postgame analysis and I think that's what's interesting. You can create an experience that is enriching engaging but you can also use the model now to take that data and give you more information. So, I'm going to ask it postgame stats and analysis left side. That's just the way I implemented it. And Christine can do the same thing and say postgame stats and analysis right side. So, why she does that? You can see already here within my widget, I've loaded up the stats from the previous game. I lost 37. Our average rally was four hits. Our longest valley was seven and I only won about 30% of the shots. And it's I still lost and it's giving me some tips. I should prioritize defense in the first return. And that makes sense because I let a lot of those balls just go score on the first shot so we can finish the game for you know demoing. but that that's context that it's an understanding and letting me know that the way for me to improve my game is to actually defend those first hits. Let's see what Christine gets. Okay. So, I'm writing in the same prompt on my side and then just clarifying that I'm on the right side. And then while this loads, Corey, just a quick call out that we're both in developer mode. Yeah, great question. so for me to have loaded this locally running app, you have to enter developer mode, which",

But for this ping-pong app that I just created, I'm running it locally and , we're in development mode. So yeah, your score now says 73. Your win rate was 70%. And what it's it's giving you what you did well, consistency, balance, exchanges, and to go even better, you can start mixing some pace and placement , to be that super advanced player. , I think this sounds pretty accurate. Yeah. But what's really fun here is we played on two different computers. You could play with any of your friends around the world. I could send somebody my MCP server and somebody else could play or this app could be published in the marketplace, which I will do, and anybody can play ping pong here in CHPT and get some postgame analysis for how to play better. So, that's really fun. So, this is an example of an app that has some more capabilities, real time stats, , multi- , , turn capabilities, and , you can use codecs to help you iterate that much faster getting there. I'm going to stop sharing, and we're going to go back to the presentation now. Okay, so here is where we left off and you just saw the OpenAI docs MCP server in action. And here's a quick recap of what we just went through. Yeah. So, please check out our developers.openai.com apps- apps-d site. That's where all the resources to go deeper, learn more information or you can just ask codeex to explain that content for you. , part of today's presentation is not just a walkthrough of the different resources and tooling, but kind of the paradigm of how , builders build today. It's really really helpful to use AI particularly codecs to parse this complicated and technical information and explain it in a way that's helpful for you. So you can ask it about you know how does MCP servers work? How should I structure my tool calls? how should I think about building out UI components? How should I think about enabling full screen? And you can use it both as a coding tool, but also a learning tool as well for you to be that much more capable and building and and just providing things in the world that are a great experience. As well, we have apps that solve a user problem that stand out. so we",

As well, we have apps that solve a user problem that stand out. so we I'll get it in the next few slides, but part of building an app is not just building to build, right? it's building for things that land and it really solve people's problems or provide them with some utility. So I'd really recommend thinking about how both your UI your model brings in some contextual data or how the user's turns in flow provide a really enriching experience. Things like postgame analysis, things like bringing in live data from an alltrades platform. so yeah, think about that about how you can really bring utility into an existing flow. And then last but not least, we talked about codecs and how to use our docs MCP server. This is just a quick slide. , you saw Corey do this live, but , feel free to take a screenshot so you know exactly how to do this. Turning on developer mode and loading in your app so you can create your own game and play with a friend. Awesome. Just doing a quick time check and we have time to now go through best practices on iterating your app. I won't go through in great detail all of these different topics, but I will touch upon the UIUX guidelines and a few other pieces in here, but I'd highly recommend to go deeper, go take a look at our docs where we have information on each of these topics. So for UX guidelines some of the things that I mentioned was you shouldn't if you already have an existing app platform that you've built separately from chatbt you should be thinking about how you distill value into the user experience today and bring something at the point in time that would provide you know a delightful experience and less of let me port over my whole experience add you know really deep multi-pageenation and things that just kind of keep you stuck within that experience. Those are great, but they're not or sorry, those are good, but those are not necessarily what great could look like because I think the power of an app within CHBT is the interaction between the model, the UI, and your MCP server. , awesome. , now looking at the screenshots here, this is just an example of a UI guideline. We have a whole page on this that goes through like the design principles, but you know little things like using the right font size you know thinking about mobile a lot of the traditional things about web development and and native development persist as well when you're thinking about building an app within CHBT but go read the docs there for some more detailed information.",

That is pre-built components to style your app. You can even tell CEX to, you know, or you can download install that package and then tell Codex to use those same components to build your app. , it's a really helpful way to kind of get your app looking in a polished state ready for app submission. So just covering some of those UX principles, extract don't port, treat chat to PT as a home. you know it owns the overall experience but you have the ability here to customize it and make an experience that is truly unique and designed for conversational entry. sometimes the users aren't always going to be you know as exact as they can be and your MCP MCP server can take that context and decide if it really wants to take action or you know let the model know that it should you know ask for more information back. You have the ability to decide if you want to act on that intent or you can you know provide an experience right away. So that's I think an important part of thinking about building a chatbt app and thinking about the different use cases and how people decide to engage with our platform and and your app as well. And what makes an app valuable? , this is subjective and we're looking for all the best cases out there, but some of the things that we have strong conviction on is at least one thing better in your app, which it either can leverage conversation and context, multi-turn dialogue that , you know, you know, you can load an initial UI, provide some information, but then you do some refinement , telling it to filter or , take an action on your behalf. and the three pillars I think you can think about that is does this help me know something more? does this help me do something more taking action in MCP or does this show me something in a better and more visually engaging way? So here are some additional resources. we have our GitHub examples. One of those in particular is kitchen sync which is a very simple not superstyled chatbt app example but it does implement all the different windowopeni capabilities that allow you to do something within the UI. So it shows you how you can interact with state, how you can open up full screen mode, picture and picture open an external link",

So it shows you how you can interact with state, how you can open up full screen mode, picture and picture open an external link implement that in your own app if you think it's a valuable experience that you would like to do today. I will quickly mention some of the app patterns here that are buckets of experiences that you may be wondering how you interact with today. we've recently enabled the control of how your app interacts with memories. as a developer you will never have direct access to memories. But what the model will do is sorry when you download a chatbt app there will now be a there is a toggle currently that says for the user do you want to allow memories to interact with your app? if they've enabled it then the model will like normal when you're interacting with CHPT reference those if it's relevant and then make a tool call to your MCP server the data won't be passed over but it will have that context when it when it makes an interaction when it makes an action and a tool call to your MCP server they can also disallow it and then your app loads in only in the context that exists within the chat conversation for monetization we have a couple different ways of doing this today. one of the you know initial examples is you can have your app have an authentication flow. So after the user installs and connects their app you could require them to log into your platform and then you can monetize by just having you know your traditional signup flows and things of that nature on your own site. Another more native way to do this is to add in a checkout like experience within your app or a button that then opens an external link to your application. And traditionally what we've seen as a good paradigm is it can deep link people to like a final state of checking out and then what we provide actually in the external checkout window. OpenAI capability is a redirect URL. So after you've completed that action on your site or platform, you can natively direct the user back into chatbt and continue the experience there. Last but not least, the agent commerce protocol and instant checkout is something that we are looking to expose to more apps, developers, and builders. so we are working really hard to get that so you can actually do native buying experiences directly in app that don't require a checkout. But today, I'd recommend exploring the first two options as way to adding monetization to your app because I know it's a topic that a lot of people are asking about. All right, let's do a summary of everything we've covered here today so",

All right, let's do a summary of everything we've covered here today so the user and the model. , there I think is a very unique opportunity here to set the paradigms and the best practices and the best example apps for a new way of development. It's not just your code and a a UI. It's both the model, your MCP server logic and a web component. You can iterate faster with AI tools in just a single prompt. I used codeex to generate out some scaffolded code and then had a very basic app and you can continue iterating and using things like our docs MTP server to load in all that context in an AI first manner to start building and iterating. And then last but not least utilize the capabilities that are available. if it's full screen mode, if it's trying to do something in real time, , be creative and think about what you can build and I'm really excited to see, you know, what you all build here in CHBT. Great. Okay, we do have some time for Q&A. U, we did flag a few, so I preloaded one. , and then we'll just take some from the chat. So, first question here, how is OpenAI compatible with MCP? So, we talked a lot about MCP today. Yeah, this is a great question. , so I've mentioned MCP in so many different fashions. Just to level set, there's the MCP server that exists for your your your app in CHBT. We also have our own MCP server, our docs MCP server that is able to be loaded in as context to any different AI, you know, tool like codeex or within cursor, VS code, etc. but as well now thinking about our platform and tools like our APIs, apps SDK, things of that nature, those are all compatible with MCP. So you can load in an M a different MCP server if it's for flight data or for you know bespoke product information, etc. you can load that into our platform and tooling to build out your own AI experiences with you know external logic and capabilities. okay, this next question was do you recommend any tooling to make the local development experience better? It's a great question. there are many different things here that you can utilize. two off the back is you do run a local server, right? So you have a local server running your MCP server. You do need to tunnel that is particularly in de development mode to run that within HBT. So that's a public URL that points to your local private MCP server that's running on your computer. So I used Enro. You can also use Cloudflare",

So that's a public URL that points to your local private MCP server that's running on your computer. So I used Enro. You can also use Cloudflare a single mpm install and then a single command to actually create those tunnels. but then when you think about production, you do need to host your MCP server somewhere with a URL that you can give to chatbt either for development mode or for the public app submission flow where we review your app and then you know load that as the experience when people connect to your app and install it for for the wide distribution. So there are a number of different hosting services out there. I would explore those if you don't have one of yourself. And for OH, O is a big topic. you can implement OOTH yourself, but there are great O providers out there. some listed on our site. And so please explore those for ways that you can implement O in a in a more seamless fashion. this is one that I just saw come in. while building the apps, can you use other colors to make the design more sophisticated? Are we only limited to what's in the design system? That's a great question. , for the most part, you have the control and freedom to design , as as as you see fit, both in terms of colors and fonts and things of that nature. There will be some things, for example, in our visual guidelines where we may call out things that are , not allowed, and so I would review those carefully, but for the most part, you should be able to build , a UI that fits your design. the UI components though currently are already pre-styled and so they have different you know params and controls to change how they operate but those are mostly built in a specific way. but you you can design your app as needed and you know during app review we'll let people know if anything is not particularly fitting well with an experience that works well for users though. Okay. , this one I think was when you were demoing the Adobe and Chatbt. , someone asked, \"Do you need an account with Adobe to use that use the app?\" That's a great question. So, for that app, I did have to sign in. , when I did sign in, they have, you know, , common sign up , buttons. So I think that's a good paradigm is if you want to create a free user experience but still have some form of authentication you can do like you know the the common providers that provide signin that allows them to create an account and then directly get into your experience but you know as they use your",

Oo, that's a that's a tough question. , we have the existing lifestyle and production categories in our app directory. we will evolve that over time but at the moment we haven't publicly shared any specific categories that we are featuring more prominently. but we will build out more specific categories as we start to improve more apps and and release them out into the ecosystem. Okay. I think that is all we have so far. , so we will just wrap up really quickly with some resources. , so here are some links. Again, I will send these out. The first one is the apps SDK. What makes a great Apache BT app? This was a whole blog actually written by Corey who's presenting today. So feel free to check that out as a recap. , an additional resource, the UI guidelines here where you can answer a lot of the questions that , I see in the chat around UI. and also link out to our UI components. And then last but not least, to build our repo, I did see some last minute questions come in on this ping pong app, how you can play, and how you can actually iterate it and make it your own. so feel free to check it check it out and come back for more build hours. So on February 18th, we will be talking about prompt caching and then on February 24th, we will come back for agent capabilities. So everything that you saw today on the m the docs mcp server and codecs are actually applicable to these upcoming build hours as well. So check out our homepage and feel free to register and catch us on demand on our openai YouTube channel. So thank you again for coming and we will see you next time. Thanks everyone.",
