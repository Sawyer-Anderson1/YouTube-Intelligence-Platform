        "text": " I think this has been happening over the last few weeks where people have gone from a month ago of like oh yeah agents are kind of sloppy quote to like the what is a little bit of a meme of like the industrialization of software when anyone can just create software at their fingerprints Like I do think we are closer to that side of things and it takes direction and like understanding how the systems work to extract that best from the language models And I think it's hard to like accept the gravity of how much is going to change with software development and how many more people can do things without ever looking at I think what's interesting is to think about whether these systems will be um independent like completely independent in the sense that well I have no doubt that LMS will kind of at some point solve coding in a sense like calculators solve calculating right so at some point humans developed a tool that you know you never need a human to calculate that number you just type it in and it's an algorithm you you can do it in a in that sense and I I think that's the same probably for coding but the question is so I think what will happen is yeah you will just say build that website it will make a really good website and then you maybe refine it But will it do things independently where so will you be still having humans asking the AI to do something like will there be a person say build that website or will there be AI that just builds websites or something or whatever i I think using talking about building websites is the i too simple It's just like there's the the problem with websites and the problem with the web you know HTML and all that kind of stuff i It's very resilient to just i slope It will show you slop as good as showing slope i I would rather like think of like safety critical systems like uh asking AI to end to end generate something that manages logistics i or manages cars a fleet of cars all that kind of stuff So end to end generates that for you I think a more intermediate example is take something like Slack or Microsoft Word. I think if the organizations allow it AI could very easily implement features end to end and do a fairly good job for like things that you want to try You want to add a new like tab in Slack that you want to use and I think AI will be able to do that pretty well i Actually, that's a really great example How far away are we from that i Like this years i See, I don't I don't know I don't know I I guess I don't know how bad",

It's because people don't want it to do it this way Some of that could be a skill issue on the human side Unfortunately, we have to be honest with ourselves and some of that could be an under specification issue So programming like you're like you're just assuming this is like in in relationships and friendships communication type of issue You're assuming the LM somehow is supposed to read your mind I think this is where spec driven design is really important Like you just using natural language specify like what you want I",
