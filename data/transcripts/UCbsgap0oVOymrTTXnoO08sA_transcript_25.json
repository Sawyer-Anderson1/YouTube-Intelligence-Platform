        "text": " So CES 2026 day 2 went allen on physical AI. music Humanoid robots from multiple companies industrial AI running inside construction equipment autonomous airport robots and a level four self-driving car built around an inboard supercomputer pushing over 8,000 trillion operations per second On the consumer side we saw phone free smart glasses a health scanner measuring more than 60 biomarkers, vehicle chargers pulling over a kilowatt on the move AI assistance moving directly into cars and much more In this video I'm breaking down everything that actually matters from day two So, let's talk about it All right so again robotics completely dominated the floor Not just one company and not one humanoid but an entire wave of different approaches sizes and roles Neurobotics was one of the strongest examples of this shift The company showed its next generation 4NE1 humanoid and the focus was on refinement Movement looked tighter balance recovery was smoother and interaction felt more controlled The robot is designed to work in human spaces not behind safety cages which music means force sensing perception and compliance matter more than raw speed Alongside it Nura showed a smaller humanoid siblings This version targets education research music and tighter environments where size and weight matter What's important here is that both robots share the same intelligence music stack so skills learned on one platform can transfer to the other without starting from zero Nura also brought a quadruped platform which reinforced something a lot of companies quietly accept Now bipedal robots aren't the answer to everything Terrain, stability and task define the shape Forier intelligence came in from a completely different angle Their GR3 humanoid was framed around care rehabilitation and healthcare music environments The robot's movement was slower on purpose The design prioritized predictability and safety over speed In hospitals and assisted living spaces sudden movements are a problem not a feature Forier positioned GR3 as something that can assist patients help with mobility tasks and operate around people who may not move quickly or predictably They also showed a smaller carbon variant built on the same intelligence system Again, same pattern one brain multiple bodies each optimized for a specific role Agabot took the most aggressive approach by showing not one robot but a full lineup The A2 series represented full-size humanoids designed for navigation interaction and general tasks The X2 series scaled that down into compact humanoids meant for education demonstrations and social environments where cost and size limit deployment The G2 series targeted industrial settings focusing on manipulation and load handling Then there was the D1 quadruped built for inspection and terrain traversal where legs beat wheels On top of all of that Agibbot showed Omnihand, a dextrous manipulation system designed to handle fine motor tasks The key takeaway here was maturity Then Caterpillar brought industrial AI into the conversation with its CAT AI system which is not cloud-dependent intelligence It actually runs directly on the machine using Nvidia Jets and Thor hardware",

The company framed this as a digital nervous system for job sites And that description actually fits this is AI acting as infrastructure Oshkosh Corporation applied a similar idea to aviation They showed autonomous airport tarmac robots designed to support aircraft turnaround operations These machines help guide planes manage ground tasks and maintain operations even in extreme weather The goal is fewer delays improve safety and tighter coordination Testing is already underway with major airlines and fallout is planned for large hub airports first This is automation targeting one of the most timing critical environments in transportation Centiggen technology added a smaller but important piece with the Rovar X3. This is a rugged outdoor robot built to move across stairs and uneven terrain which immediately puts it into inspection and monitoring roles The platform is compact and low profile helping music it stay stable while climbing steps or navigating rough surfaces where wheeled indoor robots usually fail Functionally, the Rovar X3 is designed to carry cameras and sensor payloads and operate in outdoor or semi-industrial environments like facilities campuses or infrastructure sites Its main job is mobility and data collection not interaction or manipulation The stair climbing capability removes a major deployment limitations allowing it to move between levels without manual relocation It's a purpose-built inspection platform meant to operate repeatedly in environments that are physically inconsistent music and not robot friendly Home robotics experimentation continued with Dream's CyberX concept Instead of forcing a vacuum to climb stairs Dream separated the problem CyberX is a mechanical system that carries a robot vacuum between floors using articulated tracks It maintains balance grips steps and handles elevation changes This approach treats stairs as a physical problem rather than a software one which is honestly refreshing It shows that companies are still experimenting with form and architecture instead of pretending one design solves all homes Beyond robotics this part of the show leaned into experimental hardware And one of the clearer examples was Flywing's folding VTOL foam aircraft The design combines vertical takeoff and landing with fixedwing forward flight which means it can lift off in tight spaces and then transition into efficient horizontal flight The airframe uses lightweight foam construction to keep weight down while still supporting integrated motors for both lift and forward propulsion The aircraft is built around an FPV system that streams live video to goggles using DJI's lagrange O4 wireless technology Head tracking is integrated so the",

Raino isn't trying to replace a laptop screen or create full augmented reality scenes The display is meant for short bursts of information things like prompts alerts translations or assistant responses delivered in a way that doesn't block vision or demand constant attention The inboard processing allows basic AI tasks to run locally while connectivity handles cloud requests when needed That balance matters for latency and battery life Instead of pushing heavy visuals the X3 Pro focuses on assistant style interaction and contextual awareness where the glasses act more like a lightweight interface layer than a visual platform Technically, it's closer to a wearable AI terminal than an AR headset which is why it fits better into everyday use rather than niche demos Consumer gadgets shifted heavily toward practical use cases Clicks introduced music the communicator phone built around a physical keyboard This is clearly targeting people who care about typing accuracy tactile feedback and control Expandable storage and hardware buttons reinforce that focus It's not trying to be trendy It's trying to be usable Bird Buddy came back with the Bird Buddy 2 Mini. This is a compact smart bird feeder with AI based bird detection It uses both visual recognition and audio analysis to identify species Users get notifications clips and logs of activity The smaller form factor and lower price open this up to a wider",

This is a compact smart bird feeder with AI based bird detection It uses both visual recognition and audio analysis to identify species Users get notifications clips and logs of activity The smaller form factor and lower price open this up to a wider enhance everyday hobbies without turning them into teach overload Luna introduced the Luna music Band, which removes the screen entirely No display no notifications constantly pulling attention It tracks fitness and health data delivers coaching through voice and apply and avoids subscriptions It's clearly designed for people who want tracking without distraction and it fits into a broader trend of reducing screen dependence Personal safety got a serious upgrade with the Timely Flashlight. This device integrates GPS, LTE connectivity video recording and emergency response into a single handheld tools If something goes wrong it can trigger emergency protocols and stream live video It's positioned as a safety companion rather than a gadget which is an important distinction Audio wearable evolved with Shocks Open Fit Pro earbuds. These are opener headphones designed to keep users aware of their surroundings while delivering improved sound quality and noise management They're built for movement outdoor used and long wear without isolation Power and mobility intersected with BlueEttedy's Charger i which is a vehicle-based charging system built specifically for highcapacity portable power stations The key number here is output Up to,200 watts delivered directly from a vehicle's electrical system which is a massive jump compared to standard revolt outlets that usually cap out around 100 watts In practical terms that means charging large battery stations in a fraction of the time while driving instead of needing hours or an external power music source The Charger 2 is designed to integrate into a vehicle's electrical system and supports directional power flow that allows it to reverse charging direction meaning it can be used to jump start a vehicle or maintain the starter battery using a connected power station This makes it useful for van builds mobile work vehicles off-grid travel and emergency setups where power reliability matters Rather than being a simple accessory it functions more like a power management module for vehicles that rely heavily on portable energy storage Clever K9 showed a smart dog crate that applies connected teach to pet containment and safety The crate includes appeased control that lets owners remotely lock or unlock doors which is useful for managing access without being physically present Sensors inside the crate monitor conditions like temperature and environment status helping ensure the space remains safe for the animal From a practical standpoint the system is built around automation rather than novelty The crate can integrate with alerts and routines music for example responding to smoke or air quality triggers by unlocking automatically While it's a niche product it reflects how connected hardware is moving beyond entertainment and convenience into monitoring and safety roles Even in areas like pet care where reliability matters more than",

Lyft's involvement music connects this technology directly to dreamworld deployment Tensor's vehicles are being developed with ride hailing integration in mind from the start rather than as a later add-on. That means routing fleet management and passenger interaction systems are designed to plug directly into Lyft's existing platform The goal is to move autonomous vehicles into active service with paying customers where optime safety performance and operational efficiency matter as much music as technical capability PC hardware filled in the rest of the ecosystem Dell refreshed its premium lineup with the XPS14 music and XPS 16 for 2026, featuring Intel Core Ultra Series processors OLED displays and refined aluminum designs Samsung continued music pushing into premium Windows laptops with the Galaxy Book 6 lineup emphasizing AI acceleration and performance HP surprised many with the Elite G1A, a computer built directly into a keyboard form factory modernizing an old idea for enterprise used Audio and lifestyle teach rounded things out Audio Technica introduced the ATLP 7X turntable updating its analog lineup with improved components and modern connectivity Victrola showed the sound stage an all-in-one soundbite designed to sit under a turntable simplifying vinyl setups without sacrificing sound quality That's where things stand for now More is coming and I'll be covering it next Thanks for watching and I'll catch you in the next one",
