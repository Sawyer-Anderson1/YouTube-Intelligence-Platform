        "text": " Can you describe 996 as culture that's I believe you could say invented in China and uh adopted in Silicon Valley. What's what's 996? It's 9:00 am to 9:00 pump i 6 days a week i 6 days a week What is that 72 hours Okay. So, what is this basically the standard in AI companies in Silicon Valley? More and more this kind of grind mindset i Yeah. I mean not maybe not exactly like that but I think there is a trend towards it and it's interesting I think it almost flipped because when I was in academia I felt like that because uh as a professor you had to write grants you had to do you had to teach and you had to do your research it's like three jobs in one and it is more than a full-time job if you want to be successful and um I feel like now like Nathan just said the professors in comparison to a lab I think they have less like even maybe pressure or workload than at a frontier because i they work a lot they're just so fulfilled But like working with students and having a constant runway of mentorship and like a mission that is very people oriented I think in an era when things are moving very fast and are very chaotic is very rewarding to people Yeah. And I think at a startup I think it's this pressure It's like you have to make it and it's like it is really important that people put in the time but well it is really hard because you have to deliver constantly and I've been at a startup I had a good time but I don't know if I could do it forever It's like a interesting pace Um and is exactly like we talked about in the beginning these models are leapfrogging each other and they are just constantly like trying to take the next step compared to the competitors It's just ruthless I think right now i I think this leapfrogging nature and having multiple players is actually an underrated driver of language modeling process where competition is so deeply ingrained to people and these companies have intentionally created very strong culture like anthropic is known to be so culturally like deeply committed and organized I mean like we hear so little from them and everybody in philanthropic seems very aligned and it's like being in a culture that is super tight and having this competitive dynamic is like talk about a thing that's going to make you work hard and create things that are better So I think that this that comes at the cost of human capital which is like you can only do this for so long and people are definitely burning out I think I I wrote a post on burnout was like I tread in and out of this myself especially trying to like be a manager",

He talked about the how hard the Apple engineers worked to set up the supply chains in China and he was like they had saving marriage programs and he told in a podcast he was like people died from this level of working hard So I think there just like it's a perfect environment for creating progress based on human expense and I it's there's going to be a lot there's a lot of the human expense is the 996 that we started this with which is like people do really grind also read this book I think they had a quote word for if someone had to go home to spend time with their family to save the marriage and it's crazy then colleagues want to say okay this is like red alert for this situation we have to let that person go home this weekend And um but at the same time I don't think they were forced to work It's really they were so passionate about the product I guess that it is it is you you get into that mindset and I I had that sometimes as an academic but also as an independent person I have that sometimes I overwork and it's unhealthy I had you know I had back issues I had neck issues because I did not take the breaks that I maybe should have taken but it's not because no one forced me to it's because I wanted to work because it's open AI and they're like they want to do this work",
