The capabilities of these models are improving month by month and it is not stopping [music] and also the cost of inference is coming down about 10 times per [music] year. The best class of science fiction they predict something right but in different time. This is where the underlying tech that's being developed beyond LLMs is world models. You might have heard this language being thrown around quite a bit. You might have also heard of the term spatial models. And the biggest difference between world models versus large language models is these models learn on visual information, not just being able to predict on large quantities of text, which is the realm of LLMs. Now this is going to be a huge step forward when we start integrating them more and more into our business.",
