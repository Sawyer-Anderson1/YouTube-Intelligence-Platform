We are trusted with running some of the most critical infrastructures in terms of the largest custodian with $55.8 [music] trillion of assets. Our mantra is AI for everyone everywhere and in everything. Open AI is kind of where it all started. We're on a journey to actually improve our data governance, our data quality, and being able to unlock datadriven decisions. When I say it helps us with efficiency, it's not just a number, [music] but allows us to use that time to spend valuable time with clients. We've been using AI in a way that has allowed us to [music] spend just more quality time with the clients and even more so have a quality conversation. We believe AI and specifically generative AI is going to be the operating system of [music] technology going forward. So that's the goal of Eliza, the mission of Eliza. Eliza is the innovation accelerator platform built with some of the most frontier AI capabilities. 50 plus thousand [music] employees are all AI enabled. 98% of our company have gone through the training of responsible AI. 20,000 employees have created an agent. My team has built an agent that actually can rebrand and correct all of our learning collateral. So I I like to think about it as a as a thought partner being able to multiply the amount of use cases and the impact, the cost savings, the speed and the consistency of our work products for the entire enterprise to create new ideas. Open AI continues to always have the frontier research, the reasoning models, building capabilities like deep research. This relationship allows us to know that we are not only being able to leverage the latest but also getting great advice. We always want to embrace the best [music] of what got us here, but also be excited that the best days are ahead. And AI is very much part of that ahead story based on the trust and what we're building into the future.",
