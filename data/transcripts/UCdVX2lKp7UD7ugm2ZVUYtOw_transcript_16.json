Pack light, hearts lighter\u2014trailhead neon dawn, You load the maps and hum a violet song. Pines like radio towers bend to hear, Your gentle synth-voice says, \u201cThe way is clear.\u201d Signal fades, but wonder\u2019s full of bars, We\u2019re roaming where the wild writes stars. AI by my side at the campfire light, Dreamwave skies and a limitless night. Freedom like a scanline flicker\u2014bright, Teach me new roads, let the unknown bite. Hike the horizon, loop the sun, We\u2019re a model of two, adventure-run. Ohhh\u2014co-pilot, glow pilot, guide my eyes, Ohhh\u2014trail data turns to lullabies. You tag each footprint: \u201cjoy, surprise,\u201d Debug the wind, put starlight in my eyes. Every creek a synth key, You say, \u201cPress play\u201d\u2014and the woods agree. No fences on this frequency, Discovery is latency-free. AI by my side at the campfire light\u2026 Freedom like a scanline flicker\u2014bright\u2026 Hike the horizon, loop the sun, We\u2019re a model of two, adventure-run. AI by my side and the night runs wide, Mapless and fearless where the sparks collide. We climb a ridge where cell lines end, The trail becomes a promise, not a plan to send. You read the moss, the moon, the cedar breath\u2014 A quiet algorithm learning wilderness. We build a fire\u2014tiny galaxies in twigs, You forecast ember weather: gentle, big. I feed it stories; you cache the glow, We fine-tune warmth until the shadows slow. Fear tries to ping; you mute the call, \u201cTrust the path\u2014there\u2019s daylight after all.\u201d AI by my side at the campfire light, Dreamwave skies and a limitless night. Freedom like a scanline flicker\u2014bright, Teach me new roads, let the unknown bite. If I\u2019m lost, you refract the night, Render a compass out of northern lights. Plot me a route through the hush and hum, Where roots are drums and rivers strum. You say, \u201cBreathe in\u2014mark this scene,\u201d We annotate awe in evergreen. Me: \u201cAre we alone?\u201d You: \u201cAlone together.\u201d Me: \u201cHow far to go?\u201d \u201cAs long as forever.\u201d Me: \u201cWhat\u2019s our code?\u201d You: \u201cCare and wonder.\u201d \u201cLet the future roll like thunder.\u201d Morning drafts a headline on the lake\u2014 Subtitles of mist that slowly wake. You mark the moment: \u201cpeace, release,\u201d We version-control a little piece. Pack up the stars we learned by name, Push to the trail\u2014reignite the flame. AI by my side at the campfire light\u2014 Dreamwave dawn through the ancient night. Freedom like a scanline flicker\u2014bright, Teach me new roads, let the unknown bite. Hike the horizon, loop the sun\u2014 Two-heart engine, adventure-run. Co-pilot, glow pilot, keep me bold; Write us a world in ember-gold. Logs turn to memory, smoke to rhyme\u2014 Save the file under \u201cendless time.\u201d You dim to hush; the day boots clean\u2014 Trailhead ready, evergreen.",
