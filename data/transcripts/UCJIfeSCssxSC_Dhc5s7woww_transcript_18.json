        "text": " So where would you give a recommendation for people to do a research contribution So the options are academia so get get a PhD spend 5 years publishing computer resources are constrained there's uh there's research labs that are more focused on open weight models and so working there or closed frontier labs research labs i open AI anthropic ai so on i um the two gradients are the more closed the more money you tend to get and but also the le you get less credit so in terms of building a like a portfolio of things that you've done like it's very clear of what you have done as an academic and you have done this and versus if you are going to go be like trade this fairly reasonable progression for being a cog in the machine which could also be very fun So I think it's a very different career paths but the like the opportunity cost for being a researcher is very high because PhD students are paid essentially nothing So I think it ends up rewarding people that have a fairly stable safety net and they realize that they can operate in the long term which is they want to do very interesting work and get a very interesting job So it is a fairly like it is a privileged position to be like I'm going to see out my PhD and figure it out after because I I want to do this and I think a lot of arcade like at the same time the academic ecosystem is getting bombarded by funding getting cut and stuff So, there's just like so many different tradeoffs where I understand plenty of people that are like \"Oh, I'm I can't deal with this funding search I grant got cut for no reason by the government or I don't know what's going to happened So, I think there's a lot of uncertainty and tradeoffs that in my opinion favor just like take the take the well-paying job with meaningful impact So, it's like not also like you're getting paid to sit around at OpenAI. building like the cutting edge of things that are i changing millions of people's relationship to techs i but publication wise they're being more secretive increasingly so So you're publishing less and less and less and less and so you're you are having a positive impact at scale but it's you're a cog in the machine i I think it's honestly it hasn't changed that much Uh so I have been in academia I'm not in academia anymore At the same time I wouldn't want to miss my time in academia But what I wanted to say before I get to that part I think it hasn't changed that much I um was working in um like I was using AI or machine learning methods um for applications and computational biology with collaborators and a lot of people",

What's what's 996? Just 9:00 am to 9:00 pump i 6 days a week i 6 days a week What is that 72 hours Okay. So, what is this basically the standard in AI companies in Silicon Valley? More and more this kind of grind mindset Yeah. I mean not maybe not exactly like that but I think there is a trend towards it And it's interesting I think it almost flipped because when I was in academia I felt",

I mean not maybe not exactly like that but I think there is a trend towards it And it's interesting I think it almost flipped because when I was in academia I felt had to write grants you had to do you had to teach and you had to do your research It's like three jobs in one and it is more than a full-time job if you want to be successful And um I feel like now like Nathan just said the professors in comparison to a lab I think they have less like even maybe pressure or workload than at a frontier lab because i they work a lot They're just so fulfilled by like working with students and having a constant runway of mentorship and like a mission that is very people oriented I think in an era when things are moving very fast and are very chaotic is very rewarding to people Yeah. And I think at a startup I think it's this pressure It's like you have to make it and it's like it is really important that people put in the time but well it is really hard because you have to deliver constantly and I've been at a startup I had a good time but I don't know if I could do it forever It's like a interesting pace Um and is exactly like we talked about in the beginning these models are leapfrogging each other and they are just constantly like trying to take the next step compared to the competitors It's just ruthless I think right now i I think this leapfrogging nature and having multiple players is actually an underrated driver of language modeling process where competition is so deeply ingrained to people and these companies have intentionally created very strong culture like anthropic is known to be so culturally like deeply committed and organized I mean like we hear so little from them and everybody at anthropic seems very aligned and it's like being at a culture that is super tight and having this competitive dynamic is like talk about a thing that's going to make you work hard and create things that are better So I think that this that comes at the cost of human capital which is like i you can only do this for so long and people are definitely burning out I think I I wrote a post on burnout was like I've tried in and out of this myself especially trying to like be a manager of bull mode training It's a crazy job doing this The book Apple in China by Patrick McGee.

There's also there's also a a feeling a fervor that's building especially in Silicon Valley aligned with the scaling laws idea where there's this hype where the world will be transformed on a scale of weeks and you want to be at the center of it and then you know um I have this great fortune of having conversations with wide variety of human beings and from there I get to see all these bubbles and echo chambers across snorts the world and it's fascinating to see how we humans form And I think it's fair to say that Silicon Valley is a kind of echo chamber uh a kind of u silo and bubble I think bubbles are actually really useful and effective It's not necessarily a negative thing cut you could be ultra productive It could be the the Steve Jobs reality distortion field cut you just convince each other the breakthroughs are imminent and by convincing each other of that you make the breakthroughs imminent Mhm. i Burn Hobart wrote a book classifying bubbles but essentially one of them is financial bubbles which is like speculation which is bad and the other one is like I don't know the term but effectively for bailouts because it pushes people to build these things and I do think AI is in this but I worry about it transitioning to a financial",
