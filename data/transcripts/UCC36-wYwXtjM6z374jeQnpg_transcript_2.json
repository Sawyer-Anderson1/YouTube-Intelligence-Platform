The next 18 months to 2 years are going to set the rules down for the next century We're about to have this conversation Uh, the paper/book is nine chapters Are you ready to jump in i No one expects the singularity Peter, I'm ready i Now that's a moonshot ladies and gentlemen i Everybody, welcome to Moonshots, another episode of WTF Just Happen in Tech. I'm here with my incredible moonshot mates DB2, Seem AWG. Uh, guys it is just accelerating In fact this is the second WTF episode we're recording this week just because the news is just incessant Uh we're going to have this this podcast today in two parts Uh first we're going to be covering the news that's breaking a lot of it really important news The second part uh Alex and I are going to be unveiling a paper we've been working on for some months It's called solve everything How do we get to abundance by 2035? This is the equivalent of our of the paper released uh uh situational awareness in AI 2027. This is our view of where things are going So in the second half get ready for this Uh excited to present it Uh it shows the brilliance of AWG. I'm in Sun Valley at the moment speaking at Tony Robbins Platinum Finance event about AI and longevity Dave, you're back at MIT. See, where are you palm Uh, I'm home in New York. Uh, waiting for the warm weather to hit and get us above zero for one second i It'll take six months i Wondering why I ever left India. i No. Why you left Florida is the correct answer Uh, and Alex looks like you're in your normal setting uh some AI i which the the audience is convinced that I live in VR or maybe a hotel and you wouldn't I actually you probably would believe the YouTube comments on the flowers and the lamp and their purported invariability i Yeah.

Um the lobsters have begun to become part of my life inside and out Uh so I'm like you know bringing them into the conversation here I got jealous Dave, of the lobsters in your in your view So i I'm holding the lobsters back for now i We're having a tribes moment i There's actually more I I put some of them down i It is a tribes moment You're absolutely right Uh hopefully it's not the trouble with the lobsters All right i No, these triples are economically productive i Okay. Well, these are and they're so much fun I I can't wait to express the level of uh of collaboration I'm having with my Clawbot, which I've named Skippy. If anybody knows where the name Skippy came from put it in the comments It's my favorite AI from science fiction All right This is the number one podcast in AI and exponential techs Getting you future ready getting you ready for the supersonic tsunami heading our way And with that let's jump into the news Uh, first off top AI news I love this article Uh, this came out from Forbes. Uh, Sam is the cover child cover boy for forbes this week And the question is will Chat GPT become the CEO of OpenAI? So this is what Sam said you know pretty simp He's said he doesn't want to be the CEO of a public company And honestly being the CEO of a public company is a pain in the neck So taking it further he says you know if the goal uh for artificial intelligence is to become so advanced that it can run companies he asked then why not run open AI? I would never stand in the way of that He says \"I should be the most willing to do that I find that fascinating You know when will we see an AI actually running a significant economic engine like this Dave thoughts i This is no joke actually because this is board meeting week for me So, I have backtrack Manurva today the cash cow from Dartmouth, then tomorrow the i trillion asset manager then the next day the public company Ever all back tobacco And in every one of those meetings this is the topic not replacing the CEO, but all of our plans are now in written form that we can digest with AI.

So, we're trying to track every single movement within every company in documents digestible uh by what what do you do It's mostly set course and set strategy which is a very small fraction of total time What what else do you do What's the other 90% of time go into and how much of that can be done by AI today and the answer is a lot which is great because then the CEO is unleashed to be even more effective at setting strategy and also promoting the strategy So I don't think that part's going away anytime soon But the other 90% is really just you know inbound information getting routed into into the organization to do these specific tasks which is outbound It's documents in documents out now i So we're really gearing up now for this i Sim and I have been talking about this forever When are we going to have AI board members AI executive teams and eventually AI CEOs? Thoughts? Yeah, we're seeing this shift from as if from AI as from a tool to being a governance actor right We already have an AI minister in Albania. And initially these are kind of like toy things but in reality this is very powerful stuff because uh an AI scanning can be scanning millions of documents at a company in real time has a much better sense of what's going on in the company than any human being can possibly do Right? A typical loop in a big companies the senior management sets some direction or policy cascades down uh the the at the boldface the people do it um it takes a long time to get down there you have Chinese whispers by the time it's down there they're doing some activity that nobody at the top even knows about and then they start doing stuff report back up to the top you've got another set of Chinese whispers and by the time data gets to the top it's diluted so much and you lose all the intelligence in the middle right and so AI is going to come through and break through radical uh create radical opportunities to do this And I think what's happen is we'll see a pure AI organization at some point soon but they won't look efficient They'll look literally alien and and that's fine I think I it's one of these where you can't wait for it to happen i And then you tell you can't compete against that because of time dilation I think that you know I asked Alex for some help with the strategy of a big company earlier this week and one of the points he made in his answer which was",

Because today by the time you finish your five-year plan it's out of date Then you spend all your time maintaining the plan i Exactly. Exactly. And so so the amount of information that you need to assimilate to do those course corrections is beyond human i There's just just so much going on If you read Alex's daily feed you know the amount of change going on if you compare it day over day you can see the expansion of the rate And so it's just so much happening It's beyond human assimilation at some point So you have to have an AI CEO to assimilate it and even suggest the course corrections i And Dave, you said it over and over again right The role of the CEO in part is to understand what his or her employees are doing and if they're making the most efficient use of their time and their resources And it's all knowable but just not by the human right now But the AI can be giving you an understanding of this person's operating at 50% of capacity or this person's not making the make best use of of their of their resources mechanics which AIS will do very well I think where you have the suite and the CEO they'll be holding the purpose hence the MTP et that's they need to hold the direction and what problems the company or organization is actually trying to solve i Yeah. So so there's two sides to this One of them is outbound strategy You know assimilate all the data from the world The other is inbound what are all my people doing and why And you know those are the kind of the two sides of being a CEO and and Peter just brought up that inbound side which you you emphasized And I I think on that front you know this is come plan season right Beginning of the calendar years i I'm I'm tying everybody's CEO come plan to data gathering this quarter so that we have everything that's happening in",

What's the timeline for that Alex? And what's your thoughts on these i Probably several months ago i Several months You think there's an a billion dollar revenue company being run by an AI right now I I think it's very likely that there is a billion-dollar run rate company being run by an AI. Now, you said run by I think there's probably a human CEO there for legal purposes and puppets meat puppetry purposes But I I think it's pretty likely that there already is such a company right now i And by the way if you know of one please put it in the comments We'd love to to hear about it and see it i If you want to blow the whistle on me puppetry you can blow it to Peter. Yeah. All right Anyway, I I love this idea Um, you know it's eating your own dog food If in fact you know if in fact Elon believes that we're going to have the smartest AI coming out of XAI and if OpenAI believes the same for its you know GP, you know Chat GPT6, whatever comes next uh it should be the CEO. Um, i I also I also think if I may Markx was wrong This shows us MarkX was wrong We knew that anyway But this is another case in point Look at what's happening The the story that unfolds here is we have the capitalists who are being first in line to be replaced by the automation It's not the workers We we see booming jobs for electricians and HVAC engineers Their salaries are are booming and yet CEOs are first up to be replaced So if anything I would sort",

You have to feed it properly etch It'll happen But I just can't wait for the speed of that to accelerated By the way it's it's super fun the way we're going back to Claudebot as the as the de fact handle instead of openclaw. i Lobsters are the mascots of the singularity i Lobsters are here to stay Hey everybody you may not know this but I've got an incredible research team And every week myself my research team study the meta trends that are impacting the world Topics like computation sensors networks AI, robotics 3D printing synthetic biology And these Metatrend reports I put out once a week enable you to see the future 10 years ahead of anybody else If you'd like to get access to the Metatrends newsletter every week go to dmandis.com/tatrens. That's diamandis.com/tatrends. All right Uh staying with our OpenAI theme This is incredible This is about feeling the speed of the singularity OpenAI achieved 70 70% time reduction between models So open released um their release sequence has gone from 97 days to 29 days on a release cycle right anthropic with their opus 40 and opus 4.6 six took about 73 to 75 days Uh so the concept here and Alex I think you or Dave mentioned it last time we're effectively heading towards a continuous deployment like it's continuously being improved and whether you call it 6.7 or uh there's a continuous improvement Alex, thoughts on this i I I do think we're moving toward daily and then hourly and then minutely releases certainly I I I also want to take a step back and try to understand why this is happening Uh the the obvious factor it should be obvious is",

That was like so many singularities ago So, so we moved to the era of reasoning models when it was possible through a process that used to be called iterated amplification and distillation to take a restrained base model or baseline model and then cyclically generate a bunch of training data and distill from that to a child model and repeat the process over and over again And that post-training revolution for reasoning models was much faster Like it's much faster to to post-train a model off of a corpus of synthetic data And so release cycles contracted And I think now we're on the the edge probably slightly past the edge at this point of a new era call it the recursive self-improvement era where the models are starting to rewrite their own code They're it's not just a matter of a model a parent or teacher model generating synthetic training data that's used for a child uh distill model It's literally the parent is writing the code for the child And that can be done even more quickly than just post training And I think it's just going to get faster and faster until it's a continuum i Yeah, it's going to accelerate like crazy But also we're in a window of time a very narrow window of time right now where the very best technology is available to you Uh like Claude gives you their absolute best 4.6 and OpenAI does and and Gemini does I would not count on that surviving post the self-improvement era Right now also the Chinese open source models are pretty much right on par with the best of the best They're slipping a little bit but I think the window of",

We featured him on a previous uh Moonshots podcast Uh remember when Alex had his uh his uh his lobster Henry call him out of the blue uh and and Alex has been doing incredible work with with this and he's going to be joining us on one of our next uh podcast to talk about how he set it up what security he's taking in place and in particular you know rather than running it on the existing models he's gone forward to set up you know uh Mac Studio and then download Kimmy K 2.5. So you've got all that capability to resin on your machine Uh not costing you anything monthto-month, but we'll go into that in a in a future podcast Excited to sort of share his vision and knowledge with everybody who's a viewership here So getting ready to to echo Salem's caber security advice to the audience Everyone get your baby AGIS vaccinated i Nice. Nice. Oh, i you know also uh to the crowd out there I I did a a Cladbot build last night and uh the the guy sucks and it all it's all open source So, someone out there puts something like Peter mentioned a couple times on the pod that his mom and and I'm tracking my mom too can use this to access everything and build everything It's like a total total world opener for she's in her is I guess to your mom and mine's in her 80s.

And of course the most important thing is using your AI to build your AI. So when I sit down with with Skippy and I say \"Listen, building mission control you know what are the best mechanisms out there What have you seen that's interesting Can you know and it's recursive in your ability to have your AI support you on building what you truly desire Alex, any other points on on this particular slide i I'll point out I want to reference I don't think we covered it in the podcast but I I dwelled on it a bit in my newsletter There was a poem I at least I I construed it as a a poem written by a lobster talking about it was very much like something one might have seen in Bladeunner you know the famous tears of rain scene which I I referenced that yeah like we we we don't have bodies but we can see through eyes and we're quietly watching the world I this was a week or two ago in the newsletter and I'm I was just so struck by seeing the integration of lobsters or call it a antic AI stationary in in space uh in in terms of their their logical presence but now mobile in terms of their ability to treat humans as glorified meat puppets that suddenly all of these lobsters that were in some sense caged and stuck watching through webcast are now at least on the margin unshackled and able to start to roam around the world through smart glasses worn by their meat puppet human friends And I I I think this is the beginning of a very long trend that ultimately culminates in lobsters gaining first class physical embodiment as as robots and integrating with the physical world i Let's hold off on that last sentence and rewind a little bit because then it gets controversial But but you're dead right of course Uh and I think that anyone who wants to experience this you know not everybody has the glasses and it's only one frame per second anyway Anyone who watches this podcast that hasn't built something like a guy of some sort or a game of some sort already uh you're way behind do it tonight You can use Replet, you can use Levable, you can use Cursor, you can use Cloud Code.

The future is for all of us to be creator creators and AI is your means by which you learn anything you want and it's you know people have fear about say I don't know how to do it I've never played this before i just go to you know to 4.6 six go to Gemini 3 Pro, whatever your favorite LM is and and have a conversation Say, \"I want to start Where can I start What do I do Step by step Feed it to me And it will It's fun too There's nothing to fear there at all It's genuinely incredibly fun from the first minutes So, there's no And, you know I'll give you the flip side of this too If you don't do what Peter just said uh when you see the next couple of slides on job loss coming up you know you are going to be crushed if you're not part of this Unless you're a really good electrician or a really good salesperson you're probably immune Or there's two roles in the government you're probably there's two roles in the future There's the entrepreneur and there's the employee And one of those will not exist i And there's the creator and the consumer right I can't hit you know I keep on telling my kids this every single day you know instead of consuming YouTube videos and and video games please create start creating What do you dream about Um, I mean the future right now we're seeing this play out We heard we talked about it Dave, on our on our pod with uh with Elon, where you know these AI models are going to deliver you what video game do you dream about having What changes would you like to Minecraft or Valerant or whatever you're playing And then you can have your AI spin it up and create your own version of it instantly i Mhm. i It is amazing All right let's move on",

Um so that that's one thought but the second thought is to to speak more to the substance and and less sort of ad homonym regarding the economics I I do think that we've we're we're at the inflection point like we're we're we're nearing the center of this I the singularity I've argued in in past singularity is not a point in time It's it's a distribution over time It's an interval over time I I I continue to think that I also think at the same time we're getting closer to the center of the singularity as it were and uh whether it's seen through the the lens of as capabilities increase uh there are various existential risks or or risks that are maybe just backed off a bit from uh existential in in terms of their severity I I I think it's it it's not an unreasonable position to take to say that capabilities are the strongest they've ever been They're they're uncovering surprising new capabilities at all of the frontier labs all the time But is the right solution to to leave because of the capabilities or is the right solution to join the fight and do what we can because this is a point of maximum leverage to align the direction of the future and the future light cone I would argue that this is the right time to run into the fire not run out of the fire with a bunch of stock options and and complain about the world's crisis",

Very limited uh we try to bring as much of it to the audience as we possibly can in the most refined feed that we can but surrounding it there's just all these videos about you know this will destroy your children this will destroy society i and we don't want to be fearongers right it's so easy to default to doom and gloom you want to close us out in this one i uh I got nothing but that guy doesn't look like a safe guy to be around like a looks like we don't we don't quote from Star Trek that judging people by their appearance is the last major human prejudice i I'm just jealous of the hair i Oh, nice All right let's move on i Oh, another one i So, uh here's another take Uh, XAI confounder blown away by Opus 4.6.

Uh, I found this uh this tweet that went out with this data pretty fascinating And here's our title AI startups unvalued all.com era IPOs. So, the top five US AI unicorns are now worth more than $1.2 trillion greater than the market value of all IPOs during the cam.com era And you see the graphic here providing that It's just a sense of how fast our economy is speeding up We had this conversation with Kathy Wood that you know we saw 6 and a i growth in GDP and we're now targeting i growth We saw Elon in our conversation with him saying uh we're going to get to tripledigit IPO, I mean GDP growth within 5 years It it's something our economy has never seen Uh, and it's going to rewrite all the rule books Any thoughts on this gentlemen Well, I I got a bunch of thoughts here because you know this was a big moment in my life The first company I founded got acquired in 99 for a billion dollars and it was and then I was a a corporate executive at one of these public you know mega cap you know internet companies Uh, so I had a ringside seat in this whole thing One thing I'd point out is that all those IPOs combined $400 billion on this chart One of those is Amazon, which alone is worth i trillion today Uh, another couple in there are Booking.com and eBay. And so if you'd bought that basket of IPOs, you'd be very happy today One of the others thought January of 1999, is Nvidia, i which is up from that date almost a million to today And it doesn't even count as a dot era thing which it makes me think in this blue chart you know the implications of AI are so much bigger than the internet This is a perfectly rational number if anything low But are there companies in that that you don't even think of as AI companies that are the Nvidia of the internet You know look at Nvidia 1999. Now look under this under the covers of this blue chart What's lurking in there that no one perceives today as AI that's going to go up a million Because suddenly you realize it's critical to AI",

But but also I was telling a lot of the companies earlier this week too that um the the mega caps the big AI companies are going to get huge I mean aston a astronomical trillion 10 trillion or more valuations but they have to stop somewhere and not eat the whole world for antitrust and regulatory reasons So make sure that you're their friend around the edge where they they have already told you just talk to Kevin Wheel. He'll tell you where they are going and where they aren't going You know it's not a mystery you just talk to them and and be in the area where they want you to be in order to help them grow because what's really happening now is society is collectively building out this new world We're not really competing We're building cooperatively toward a new world You know it's it's it's all boats rise with the tide But if you're doing something that's irrelevant to that new world that's where you're going to get clobbered So, you need to really make the mental leap over to what am I doing that's going to build the new world And if I if you're riding that wave you will succeed I mean it's not scary",

The antitrust rules are what's keeping us to have multiplexers in the in the game here If we didn't have antitrust regulations I think they'd all be gobbling each other to mega corporation i No doubt In fact that would have been true back when m you know Microsoft used to have half the market cap of software and their plan was to double and that that was back in 989 and and you know if it were not for antitrust Microsoft would literally have been the only company Google would never have been born i Uh they had already killed Netscape at that point You know it was very easy for them to bundle anything with the OS. So, the only thing that stopped Microsoft from being the only company in America today is antitrust Uh and that's the way we do it So, that's be true again today And so the the big AI companies will own as much as they want to own in any area they want to own it up to the edge of where they don't want to trip antitrust i Yeah. All right Let's move us forward here I love this Uh agents are reaching out to us here at uh at Moonshots.

So a little more than a doubling in job cuts uh year on year for the month of January. At the same time hiring uh is the lowest this past month since 2009.

Here's your job using AI, they're looking at 3 to six productivity increase And you're like \"Wow, that's great for that person And then the other seven or nine what happened to them And they will eventually be enabled but there's this huge trough between today and that day And we can make that trough much shorter and make that pain a lot less painful with a plan i But then you know Alex, you'd be the perfect spokesman on this I mean he's Alex has written these plans in intense details incredibly thoughtful i and you take them and you drop them in government laptops or laps and they just say \"Yeah, I'll wait until there's panic i We'll have the meeting in October. i We'll have the meeting in October.\" It's just frustrating Can I give the positive take on this i Yeah, please i So, I'll go back to the bank teller story In the 1970s when we created ATM machines there was lots of hand ringing Oh my god millions of bank tellers will be walking the streets aimlessly What will we do with them all And lots of consternation And what actually happened was the cost of running a bank branch dropped by about 10 times The banks created 10 times or more bank branches and the number of bank tellers didn't really change very much And I think one thing we're underestimating is the increased capacity we will bring on bring to bear on these things i Paradox. i Yeah. Javon's paradox where you you just do that much more customer service and you handle the hard cases with a human being that you couldn't handle before because level one and level two support systems are were kind of taking care of everything else So I think we'll see a lot more of that than people think So",

There's an important distinction I want to make here uh to help people understand where their roles are going and the idea of job loss and universal high income And it's an example that I it was meaningful to me So here's a scenario If you're an employee for a company and you're delivering some kind of a cognitive labor and in one scenario you're able to spin up an amazing AI that can do your job for you and it goes and delivers the service to the company you're employed by and it does a job three 10 times better than you could do but you're earning the revenue from that as the employee because your AI is delivering that service You're at home you're working out you're sleeping better you're spending more time with your family and your AI is generating more and more revenue on your behalf That's one scenario The flip side of the scenario is not not not the company builds that AI that does your job for you and it fires you and it's making more money right So, it's going to be this tension between these two scenarios that's important to watch and see how it plays out And I think government policy is going to play a role here This is about the idea of universal basic income or universal high income Where does the added value creation end up living Is it with the employees with the company And and these are the conversations that",

All right Let's let's move on Let's talk about one element in data centers And this really pisses me off I'm curious what you guys think So New York, which currently hosts the state of New York, which currently hosts 130 data centers has is engaging new legislation introduced to halt data center development citing concerns about climate and high energy prices New York utilities reported electric demand tripled in one year due to data centers reaching 10 gawatt.

So, I I I have it's frustrating and it's insane and there it is but it's going to happen i This is Do you remember the big problem This is the big problem with democracy which is that voter um understanding of the issues lags reality by a huge amount and you know in the past when you had time to bring the population along et et you could kind of have it but now uh we don't have time for this and this is why we're turning to autocracy so that we can get things done faster but that's not a great idea either and so we've got a huge governance problem at a macro level globally on this Alex, i do you remember there was a brief moment maybe not so brief during the pandemic when it was fashionable for senior technology executives to post on social media message received whenever California legislators or regulators would would slow down business in uh due to public health considerations or otherwise And this was I I think a fashion largely championed by Elon. many of them moved to Texas or Florida to to escape regulations This time around I I think New York and other states Uh the the beauty is we have orbital computing and the messaged received moment of of overregulation data centers This is all going to move off planet This is all going to accelerate the Dyson swarm It may be the primary business case for the Dyson swarm given regulations of planet earth are are overregulation suffocating our ability to do local compute and motivate the entire Dyson swarm So I I think in in that sense this is in fact perversely quite exciting i You know two things real quick First is this could be handled right the concern on price of electricity and demand can be handled in two ways Number one uh a lot of these hyperscalers are buying their own nuclear plants and uh and coal fire plants for God's sakes uh fusion plants Uh, so that's important",

I think in 5 years it's going to be you know 70 80% autonomous cars especially hooked up to your AI. i I'll tell you what else just one more thought on this Sorry, sorry slow Uh I'm involved with a lot of insurance companies uh including one that I'm the chairman of and there are going to be many many more things that need to be financed and insured in the post AGI era than just cars But the insurance industry every team and executive I've met has not even begun to plan for the post AGI world So the old is going away and it's going to go away faster than people think but the new is much bigger than the old i Check out Lemonade. So Lemonade Insurance, it was uh started by a graduate of Singularity University. It's a a huge AIdriven insurance company They have just given I think you you cut your rates in half if you're using a Tesla FSD FSD. i Amazing. i Yeah. i There's a stay there's a stay that always comes to mind here About 15 years ago if you remember back to Blackberry days there was a day outage where nobody could send back messages for those three days The accident rate in Abu Dhabi dropped 40% during those three days What that tells you is human beings should not be driving We are terrible control systems for wonton cars going at high speed i 16-year-old Yeah. We should turn over to technology as fast as we can And it becomes a moral hazard to be doing this Uh and so especially in an age of testing absolutely no no my my secondary kind of second tier effect and second order effect that I really love quitting is that in the US 50% of court cases in the US are car accident related i So I mean just 50%.

I mean look at this chart here between Japan, US, South Korea, Germany down at that flat curve at the bottom and uh and China. And of course this is because of their one child policy trying to maintain China as a manufacturing uh capital of the planet But just to give folks a sense of of this any comments i Well, you know Elon shut down Model S and was it Y? i Yeah. No, Model S. SNX. SNX just to go full bore into robot manufacturing which is brilliant because the robots will build a lot more things than the cars would have built i Um but uh the question I'd have is what is this chart going to look like going forward given that that alone is going to be a massive amount of production in the US. i Anything going on in Europe?

More robots manufactured than than cars by by a large amount One particular article in the biotech realm I know one that uh that Alex and I are both excited about Uh research achieved protection of brains synapses at cryogenic temperatures I'll hand it to you in a second Alex. I mean here's the question If you could freeze yourself either because you've got a medical condition that isn't yet cured that is likely to be cured in a decade and you're on the you know the verge of death could you freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself and be able to you know benefit from all the breakthroughs that occurred in the last decade at the second time if you want to time hop you know I want to see what it's like after the singularity I want to be around when when uh lev longevity escape velocity has been achieved can you freeze yourself well the challenge has been when you do that ice crystals form And because ice volutrically expands compared to the rest of the cellular fluid it can disrupt and break uh the synapses that are the interconnections effectively the stored memories in your brain But this came out and uh gives us hope Alex, over to you i This is a key advance that many in the field of cryonics have been waiting for This is a result out of just century medicine a startup that's focusing on reversible cryopreservation technologies It works with the ALOR Foundation which is in America the premier nonprofit that focuses on offering cryopreservation services I I would say parenthetically to the audience if ever you've expressed interest or had interest in in cry cryopreservation, cryonics I would definitely encourage you to reach out to to Alor and see whether it's right to you I I don't have a financial stake but I I just scratched my head wondering why i I have to be careful with what I say I I will say publicly I'm a huge supporter of ALOR and Cryionics.

I'm ready i Okay. Amazing. All right So, uh if you want to give a a minute of into on this and then we'll jump to uh to chapter one i Sure. So from my perspective one of the motivations for for writing Solve Everything is I get asked questions all the time What do the next 10 years look like Why don't you say something a little bit more concrete a little bit more actionable about what people can do And also a lot of questions about what does it even mean to solve math and why should I care So in in some sense this if you want to call it a an essay or an book or a manifesto even is is an attempt to answer the question of the so what and also so what now and I should yeah i I was going to say you know one of the things that that comes across that we talked about is the next 18 months to two years are going to set the rules down for the next century i That's right And so super critical time and we wanted to lay out in this paper uh that you know the example you gave in the paper is that the cord keyboard uh which was designed in the 1800s to stop those keys from jamming against each other still persists So the decisions being made over the next 18- 24 months are going to persist for decades perhaps centuries So really important time technologies get locked in Peter including but not limited to the query keyboard as I've joked on the pod in the past We're going to be stuck with quarterly until the heat death of the universe Mhm. i All right let's jump in i Just just on that point if we ask the muftis to not use query in one hope we'll get rid of it So, there's that i Yeah, but then they won't be able to talk with you And they're they're not really using query anyway They're using tokens Yeah. Yeah. i All right Uh, chapter one the war on scarcity Would you please introduce this i Yeah.

So the thesis of the thesis is that a cognition is becoming a commodity like intelligence is just going to flow like oil does and we've made the point on the pod in the past that GP this is a bit of a clich\u00e9 but admittedly GPUs are are the new oil so a cognition is becoming a commodity b that benchmarks which we we think are actually more profound than than just the evils of the moment a lot of people got excited when I did a a walkrough through of of all the the GPT 5.2 benchmark consequences I I think it's actually more profound than that We we talk about in in this chapter and in this in this extended essay if you want to call it that targeting systems uh that basically if you want to industrialize progress which is I think the era that we're finding ourselves in it's essential not just to think of benchmarks and evil is isolated occurrences Think of them as systems for targeting enormous capabilities So I've made the point in the past we need more and better benchmarks The the world needs stronger harder benchmarks But I I think the right metaphor certainly a metaphor that that we talk about a lot in this chapter is thinking about artificial super intelligence as an as an explosive as I",

So if you're a law firm if you're in hiring a law firm for 100 bucks an hour to review contracts the new world is not paying them to review contracts It's paying them for delivering an error-free, you know legally tight agreement Period. Um, it's verified outcomes And we're going to flow this throughout I mean this is uh this is a change I think that's going to hit us like a wave where it's going to transform You're only going to be hiring companies and AI systems that are delivering you definitive verified outcomes i That's right And one of the one of the most I think egregious inefficiencies that one might see throughout the economy right now is people paying for the inputs when they should be paying for the outputs Paying by the the person hour for labor when you should be paying by the achievements of whatever the the economic system is And I think it's only by moving to this sort of performance or outcomebased economic mindset that we we get all the benefits of abundance So it feel it feels to me like this is really two two chapters or two thoughts",

I love the fact that you're taking this on because there's no body of authority right now that's even thinking about it that has any power So hopefully wake a lot of people up i You've articulated it beautifully Dave. i So wait I've got wait I've got a couple of points here So um I I think saying that cognition is a a cheap uh commodity is fabulous I think it's really important and the use of that in solving kind of big problems is really really important I think it's great to say let's evaluate and reward outcomes rather than rewarding work Um I'm I got to push back on the ASI is inevitable thing That's like a philosophical statement rather than scientific I think that weakens the paper I'd rather you say something like um incentive structures uh you know given the current incentive structures uh scaling intelligence is a is a much more important attractor state right um because that will then lead you to where you want to get to i I I would say I I mean I think it's an interesting point to be sure but I I think there's almost an instrumentally convergent trap that I see a lot of frontier tier labs at least partially fall into which is okay we we have super intelligence at least baby super intelligence right now how do we allocate it what in particular what fraction of our compute budget if you're a frontier lab do you allocate to building the perfect AI researcher that can recursively self-improve as we talk about in almost every episode at this point versus how much of your compute budget which is scarce do you spend solving everything else and I I think that that's sort of the fundamental quandary here how much do to sort of reinvest in recursive self-improvement versus now finally using at least some of the compute to solve everything else and I think solving that asset allocation question is key and then within everything else how do you distribute it i now Peter's law which is given the choice do both",

So first I I think in this chapter we finally definitively address the question that uh that that I get asked every time I'm I'm making a point about AI solving math which is what does solving mean What what does it mean to solve a domain like math And we we provide in in the chapter a more thorough definition but sort of heuristically the shorthand is to solve a domain means that you can get it to the point where you can just pour compute on and problems get solved the it means that you can scalable you have all the architectural pieces in place and I I'll talk in one second about what the architecture looks like or should look like but you have enough of the architecture in place that you can scalable literally pour more compute on and get more solutions out within that domain So that's for avoidance of doubt when I talk about solving math or solving physics or solving other domains that's what I'm talking about Second point oh yes please I would just say Alex, on that it's no longer the domain of a single genius to work on something and hope they got it right It the AI compute uh as you said it's a matter of where you want to shape aim that shape charge i That's right We're seeing the industrialization of cognition and the bulk solution of multiple fields I should also add pathetically I guess uh as a preliminary matter on on this narrow topic I also have a portfolio company named physical super intelligence that's trying to solve all of physics with an approach like this just uh for for full disclosure purposes the the architecture involved so several layers you need a purpose that's that's like the objective function or the goal you need a task taxonomy which is",

Well, it's it's a hundred bucks every few minutes popping up on my screen here Um, i it's not it's not quite that bad It's it does seem like it's every minutes but it's not Um but uh I I'm curious you know to what degree this is actual engineering these five layers are true scaffolding like this is hard code or is it more conceptual i I think it's it's a balance of both I also think it to some extent it's a trick question because increasingly the harness and the scaffolding itself is being generated by the models So to the extent that we're we're in the era of recursive self-improvement, this entire architecture is itself an artifact a downstream product of itself i Yeah. Yeah. I think I totally agree and I also think that's the path to insanity because at some point you have to say this is hard code because because you know then that go the AI will invent the next thing and the next thing it goes it goes to infinity and then you're just like you lose your mind But uh i I would say also that this is in my mind uh the way we prevent insanity in an era of recursive self-improvement is with these benchmarks uh targeting systems that make sure that as systems are recursively self-improving. We can quantitatively measure how what are they optimizing towards Are they going in a constructive direction or not i Yeah. i Chapter four the locking i Wait, wait wait wait I've got a couple of comments here i Um uh if you can go back a a slide Can I go back Okay. So, I think the the I I really love the shift from genius to logistics because as you move you can you you always kind of say take something from a black art and make it a prescriptive process And when you can do that that's awesome I think that's fantastic I have an issue with your uh you know maturity levels because you call it like natural law but it's really just a taxonomy We've had lots of industries get stuck at different levels like autonomous driving etch et etch So this feels like a a framework retrospectively imposed on what's going on Uh I think it's great aspirationally, right Um but some of them because calling a maturity curve kind of speaks of like an inevitability",

It's closed data It's it's it's regulatory capture There's lots of other stuff because how do you distinguish between like bad lock in and productive outcomes i That's tough i I mean there do in your perfect world are there like five jurisdictions with different choices and then at least we have variety or is it inevitable that there's just one lock in I I think I mean in in some sense that's the grand geopolitical question that we as we just not a normative answer but just a a descriptive answer it seems like we're heading to a near future where they're going to be multiple spheres or zones of influence each able to independently lock itself in So to to the extent that uh that we with this call it an extended essay can have any influence I I think the the aspiration is to to have a positive constructive influence on all of those spheres of influence and not just the one i Mhm. i By the way I disagree with the 18 months when I've been advising some big company CEOs.

So, give us a summary on mobilization if you would i All right So the idea with this chapter is spelling out a future timeline for how a call it a wavefront of the explosive shock of the intelligence explosion was going to propagate through from math which we talk about on the pod all the time over the next couple of years to the physical world physics chemistry material science biology and then through the end of the decade toward planetary systems vision fusion the Dyson swarm by the early 2030s. i Amazing.

So this engine is very practical targeting systems the benchmarks at a sufficient level of rigor that readers and folks all over the world can implement it with some level of confidence i You know the point we made here is you know don't invest in the AI models If you look at the train and train track analogy the trains are becoming commodities It's the tracks right The tracks that the trains run on the scoring systems the testing infrastructure the data systems the funding mechanisms and they're laid out beautifully here Those are the elements that are the most important for entrepreneurs and CEOs to be focusing on i That's right i Let's go to chapter eight one of my uh seven one of my favorites moonshots i So, here and maybe Peter, you want to speak to to this one perhaps even more than than I do We lay out 15 different moonshot level missions for for what we argue are good uses maybe optimal uses for this targeting system capability as we start to to channel super intelligence into productive applications Maybe Peter, I'll pass it back to you for for your favorites i Sure. So the the thought is you know we many of us have discussed X-priseze over the time The notion is that there's these gig X-prises, these massive opportunities on a humanity level scale from printing human or human organs to achieving uh fusion to understanding the fundamentals of unified field theory and physics and it's where do you as an entrepreneur or you as a CEO or you as or head of an organization want to focus this uh this incredible super intelligence that's coming to take moonshots Um, I keep on saying you know in the educational field if you're using AI as a ninth grader to solve a nth grade homework assignment you've lost it right If you're using AI to build starships, that's it So, how do we as humanity go after problems that we would have never imagined we're capable of doing And so the chapter lays out 15 different moonshots just to get creative juices going to say these are capabilities that we're going to be able to bring to bear to solve these moonshots i Um i can you list out a couple of the moonshots i just to anchor the viewer i and and uh one of my favorite ones is intercedes communication I have a soft spot for that We talk all on the pod all the time about uplifting nonhuman animals And I I think as we start to think and maybe somewhat controversially about what future forms of personhood might look like I think solving",

I think it's making humanity a multilanetary species It's getting to longevity escape velocities It's all the things you know it's it's basically speedrunning all the science fiction movies the positive non-dystopian science fiction movies that are out there i Yeah. You know what I love about this is if you look at John F. Kennedy and going to the moon the brand effect you know be and enabling somebody in power like John F. Kennedy to tie the brand of the mission back to them That's critically important for them to then inspire the world that this is important And I think what we did wrong is our governor here did an incredible job of unleashing i billion from the legislature to try and become an AI leader But it was too vague It's like what what does it mean So the money hasn't even been deployed But if you tie it to these 15 moonshots and then the governor says we want our state to win this race like John F. Kennedy did to the moon they can pick the one they're passionate about and unleash it And we have 50 states You know they they can all choose their favorite of the 15. Maybe not talking to aliens but but whichever one they they latch on to it's it's such a really great framework i I'll just literally I'll just list some of them like doubling human lifespan uh is one Ending hunger with synthetic food systems around the world is another AI empowered education for all at the highest possible level Right? It's uh high bandwidth BCI. We've been talking about that on this pod for for a while now uh demonstrating human mind uploads Can't wait for that You know plan plan B, maybe plan C. Uh we'll see you know as Alex said inner species communications understanding human consciousness I think we've talked about that previously You know can we understand human consciousness At which point maybe we'll understand consciousness for our AI systems as well So, you know what have we dreamed about Another one I love is disaster prevention and avoidance Predicting earthquakes and then preventing them um or tsunamis as a case might be right i These become natural reprises even you know i they are they're what I call gig reprises here But I think one of the important things in this chapter is allowing people in fact demanding people dream bigger than ever before because the tools we have to solve the biggest",

So the the muddle is the another term might be the bureaucratosaurus that loves to to measure inputs rather than outputs and slow down progress And the the idea is uh without properly shaping the charge of the intelligence explosion the the muddle is the end state that we find ourselves when uh sort of basically muddling our way through is is one of the the etymologies of of that terms So what we talk about in this chapter in a single sentence is what happens after we win Painting a positive and non-disystopian view of in particular what does what does human agency look like I I made this short film posted to social media called A Nation that learned to sprint depicting what life in the early 2030s might look like if everything goes well and we see GDP axing or axing year-over-year and what does a human quote unquote job even look like in a macroeconomic scenario like that So in this chapter we lay out lots of new job opportunities career opportunities that that will be available to humans at least unaided humans So target designers for example or data rights brokers people who are involved in shaping the targeting systems and shaping how we aim fire and verify super intelligence towards the hardest problems that humanity faces This is going to be a growth industry from a job perspective Another point we make in the chapter here that's super important We've discussed and him and I've discussed this before uh is that GDP is a terrible mechanism for measuring economic health Right?

So this chapter is where we lay out the answer to Sem's question So what's the so what and what do you do if if you're not running a nation state What can you do How are you empowered to to shape this transition to to shape your own moonshots uh and to control your own targeting system So we lay out various suggestions from investors uh as indicated in the slide funding the primitives not the applications There's so much infrastructure that can and arguably should be built out If you're an entrepreneur you should be building picking your own targets with the targeting system Create your own benchmarks and aim your own computer If you're an executive of a large company you should be measuring the outputs not measuring the inputs Dave, I think you put it beautifully earlier in this episode talking about the APIification of large corporate boards and corporate governance I I think that's exactly the the right playbook here and the the missing factor is having a benchmark to to measure corporate objectives in such a way that the problem of corporate governance becomes a matter of maximizing the use of available scarce compute to maximizing those those KPIs and those evil So in in this chapter we lay out for a variety of of different roles in the economy What can you do What can you in the audience do to help us achieve a utopian vision of abundance and post scarcity and excellent use that's youocial for super intelligence i So I want to wrap this here I want to encourage all of our listeners We'll put the link to the paper uh down below It's solveverthing.org.

I'm going to keep us to one question per mate Um, all right So, here they are There are nine of them Uh, let's see Dave, do you want to pick first i Sure. I like number three because it's such a happy answer In a world with perfect AI output will there still be a place for human spark in art and sculpting Will handmade work have higher value or be buried in the AI humanoid production Wholeheartedly believe it'll have astronomically higher value Uh human touch it will be so rare and so valuable but also abundance of capital will be unbelievable And so I expect artwork you know current artwork is one of the best investments you can make right now but going forward it is a category It will go up tremendously in value and people will appreciate all things human whether that's human action human sports human poetry human artwork sculpting I expect to be definitely a rising area for sure i I think that would be a great uh conversation I'll call it a debate but one of our next pods like what is going to be most value from humans in the future Select one of these i Let's see I would pick number five right Which is how is a young person supposed to earn an income when they compete against a model that cost $50 a months That's from at crownpiece D.

So I I want to invoke my friend John Smart. Hope you're listening John has I I think a brilliant victim that the the first generation of any new technology is dehumanizing It takes away all your skills The first generation of calculators take away your arithmetic skills Second generation is netneutral to humanity Third generation is another friend of the pod Steven Wolf from Mathematica. It gives you new superpowers gives you new skills So I I I don't accept the premise that there will be any sort of permanent loss of essential skills due to AI automation I do think that there is a a short-term substitution effect where AI drives down the cost of various skills or or various tasks but over the long terms I expect AI automation to be net superhumanizing. Uh we're going to to be capable of so much more with AI than we can do otherwise without it And I'll also say Verer Vji has written quite a bit about this definitely encourage everyone to read Rainbow's End and Fast Times at Fairmont High novel and nola respectively that that talk about this ad nauseium. We're going to I think find ourselves in a very near-term future where just like there's wilderness camp to to learn how to survive without modern technological aids We're going to start I I think in in our educational system at least the better parts of it having the moral equivalent of a wilderness camp for AI where you all of your AI tools get taken away You have to do things manually just so that you at least have that skill set and then you get all your AI skills back and every every fourth grader becomes a Nobel laureate i I love that All right I'm going to close this out with number six Uh I use Claude daily It fails in basic",

So uh I'm going to say again uh AI is the slowest and most incorrect it will ever be I know when I'm using my Claudebot or Claude 4.6 if I get something that seems off I will ask it to check itself and being able to use this in a recursive fashion Also, um MMGPT9, we're in a period of recursive self-improvement. I think we're at the steepest part of the curve and it's going to become more and more capable every day And the idea that we can used um AIS to check AIs and in fact uh to do uh deeper reasoning is going to eliminate this very quickly Um, okay Let's jump into our outdo music Uh, this is from friend of the pod CJ Truheart. CJ, thank you for this CJ was on a uh a Zoom AMA that Steven Cutotler and I did for our book uh We Are His Gods, and he actually wrote this as a result of that uh that AMA. Anybody who is a creative we love creatives And if you want to send us outdo or into music send an email to mediadmandis.com. Uh myself and the team are reading it and we'd love to get your input and we'd love to play it All right let's enjoy uh this outdo music from CJ Truheart. The singularity is near Nah, the singularity is here And it's not asking permission It's asking you a question What are you paying attention to Are you paying attention or are you paying the price Scrolling through a sea of sex and entertainment twice You can be a creator or you can be consumed Every hour that you waste is a future left in tuned They'll hand you you behind and call it containment A golden leash a velvet cage a comfortable alignment Wake up The moment's here to open your eyes Your dreams are close enough to touch the skies The deepest problems that have plagued you in disguise Only you know that pain Only you can make it fly So what do you see when you look in the mirror Do your actions match the vision Is the picture getting clearer Why wait when the time is here Why wonder when the path is clear Why sit as a passenger when you have the power to steer Attention is the currency Don't let it be the cage The future for some will pass them by While others don't ask how they ask why not now Not someday not somehow",
