        "text": " Morning ink on caf\u00e9 napkins, windows fog with rhyme, Notre-Dame in scaffolds breathing centuries of time. Notebook like a river, pages catching light, I sketch a little Paris, the model sketches night. Boulevards like vectors, curving through my mind, Every turn a feature I\u2019ve been tuning to find. Maps unfold, I follow lines\u2014 Left Bank logic, Right Bank signs. Prompts on the Seine, let the city run, Style-transfer sunsets on the water\u2019s run. I ask and it answers\u2014lumi\u00e8re in code, Verses in arrondissements, stories on the road. Prompts on the Seine, where the pulse is slow, Learning like a wanderer under neon-glow. Brushstrokes in the Louvre, pixels on my screen, D\u2019Orsay clocks keep tempo for a synth-pop dream. Montmartre hums in chorus, rooftops breathing blue, I loop a little chorus like the carousel at Tuileries too. Station F at midnight, keyboards clack and sing, Models train like sparrows on an iron-lace ring. Steps ascend, the skyline learns\u2014 Weight and wonder, loss that turns. Prompts on the Seine, let the city run, Style-transfer sunsets on the water\u2019s run. I ask and it answers\u2014lumi\u00e8re in code, Verses in arrondissements, stories on the road. Prompts on the Seine, where the pulse is slow, Learning like a wanderer under neon-glow. M\u00e9tro lines like neural graphs, converging under stone, Caf\u00e9s buzz like GPUs, no one learns alone. Accordion of traffic, jazz in cellar rooms, We fine-tune in the moonlight while the chestnut trees bloom. Prompts on the Seine, raise the gain of night, From Pompidou to La D\u00e9fense, parameters of light. I write and it writes back, a duet in the rain\u2014 Paris past and present in the model of my brain. Keep the river running, keep the questions wide\u2014 Every fresh arrondissement a version on the side.",
