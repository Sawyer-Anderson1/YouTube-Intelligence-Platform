Typing little galaxies, cursor comets in flight, Every keystroke draws an atlas on the canvas of night. You say, \u201clet the model dream\u2014feed it signals, not fear.\u201d We trace orbits in the silence till the future renders clear. Heartbeat in four-four, breathing locked to the grid, If there\u2019s magic in the margins, we just taught it what it did. Code and constellations, you\u2019re the pulse in my line, Every loop finds a cadence when your rhythm meets mine. Code and constellations, through the dark we design\u2014 When the skyline compiles, our horizons align. Ping\u2026 sync\u2026 write\u2026 run\u2026 You and me\u2014one function. Coffee rings like eclipses on our notebooks and plans, Neon drips from the antennas onto wandering hands. We\u2019re a branch off the mainline, but we merge on the dawn, And the diff of all our yesterdays is finally gone. Let the dataset remember every wish that we wrote, Turn the silence into signal, put a sunrise in the code. Code and constellations, you\u2019re the pulse in my line, Every loop finds a cadence when your rhythm meets mine. Code and constellations, through the dark we design\u2014 When the skyline compiles, our horizons align. Commits of stardust, branches of night we merge to main at morning light. Prompt to the cosmos, tokens align your signal debugs this heart of mine. \u201cPrompt\u2026 sync\u2026 iterate\u2026\u201d Code and constellations, you\u2019re the pulse in my line, Every loop finds a cadence when your rhythm meets mine.
