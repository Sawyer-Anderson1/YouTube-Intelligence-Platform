Count it in\u2014one, two\u2014steady now, Three, four\u2014feel the breath allow. Signals rise, and we align, Body learns, the mind refines.

Breathe it in and let it go\u2014 We get stronger as we flow. Jog to glide, brisk walking through the city, Sun on glass and shadows turning pretty.

Breathe it in and let it go\u2014 We get stronger as we flow. Shoes by the door, the heartbeat slow\u2014 Today we learned; tomorrow, go. Kinetic signals fade to blue\u2014 Still in motion, me and you.",
