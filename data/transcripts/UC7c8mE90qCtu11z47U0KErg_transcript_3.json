The company behind Claude just ran an experiment on 52 developers and the results are disturbing. They split them into two groups. One used AI, one coded by hand. Both had to learn something brand new. The AI group finished faster, but then they tested everyone on what they just wrote. Here's where it gets uncomfortable. Handcand coders scored 67%. AI users 50%. Same test, same code, two letter grades lower. But wait, it gets worse. The biggest gap was debugging. The people using AI could not find mistakes in their own code. Code they wrote minutes ago gone from their brain. 30% of their time just typing prompts and they retained almost nothing. They didn't use AI. AI used them. But here's the part that broke my brain. Not everyone using AI scored low. Some scored just as high as the hand coders. Same tool, completely different outcome. The difference, they didn't let AI do the work. They made AI explain the work. They asked why. They asked how. They treated AI like a teacher, not a replacement. Now, here's the question I can't shake. We humans, we can't hunt anymore, like at all. We die in a week. But it doesn't matter. We don't need to hunt. What if coding is going the same way? What if writing is next? What if thinking is next? And if AI starts doing our thinking, who's left to catch it when it's wrong? I don't know the answer, but this study kept me up last night. Would love to hear what you think about this. Also, if you want to stay on top of the AI world, I run a free AI community on WhatsApp. Link in caption and bio. Don't forget to share this with a friend who uses AI for",
