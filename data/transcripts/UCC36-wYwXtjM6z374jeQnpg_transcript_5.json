        "text": " I'm a proponent, broadly speaking, of AI personhood. And I guess I'll play the contrarian role that I'm painted as of respectfully disagreeing with with my friend Rey that there aren't benchmarks. I I think there is been over the past 2 years, marketked progress toward developing quantitative benchmarks for call it self-awareness rather than consciousness. I see progress toward developing real benchmarks for self-awareness and models. Yes. But I give you a something else that's even more perplexing. There's lots of conscious people. Now, I can't prove that that you're conscious, but I believe that you are. But why do I have the consciousness I have? There's all these conscious beings, but there's one person that I relate to that if something happens to it, I care about it in a different way than I care about other people, my own consciousness. Why am I the person that I am? You could think the same thing about yourself, but it's a subjective view of consciousness. Why am I the person that I am? And that's really hard to explain. Well, of course, Rey, it's such an ironic question that in my mind, ha, that you're asking an anthropic question. What you just posed, why am I myself is the most fundamental anthropic question that one can ask. And the usual answer is, if the universe or your own identity had sufficiently different properties, you wouldn't be around to ask the question, why do I? or it's very hard to even ask the question and people don't actually quite understand it. Maybe the f most favorite comment you've ever made for me was we were at a a group of singularity folks. We'd had a couple of glasses of wine and somebody asked about consciousness and you said language is a very thin pipe to discuss concepts that are this complex. And it just blew everybody's mind.",
