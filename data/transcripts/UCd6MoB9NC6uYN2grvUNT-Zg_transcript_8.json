One thing is just like a willingness to interact with the models a lot and to like really look at output after output and to use this to get a sense of like the shape of the models and how they respond to different things to be willing to experiment. It's actually just like a very empirical domain and maybe that's like the thing that people don't often get. I try and explain like some issue or concern or or thought that I'm having to the model as clearly as possible and then if it does something kind of unexpected you know you can either ask it why or you can try and figure out what in in the thing that you said caused it to kind of misunderstand you. I find the work extremely interesting. I think it highlights really interesting depths to the models.",
