It starts now [music] [music] Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Alexander Novak, [music] [applause] first deputy chairman of the executive board of spare, Alexander Vidyin. [applause] Mr. Novak welcome to AI journey the 10th AI journey conference. I am very pleased to be standing here with you and I ask you to open this day. Thank you Alexander. Good afternoon dear colleagues, dear friends. I am happy to welcome all of the participants and guests of the business day of the 10th anniversary AI journey conference. Over the 10 years, the forum has gained momentum in the business and scientific community, become a staple and landmark, a platform where scientists, engineers, and industry leaders gather together to discuss the impact of technology on the quality of life and economic growth. Russian economy is undergoing a period of transformation looking for new areas of growth. As you know, the president has established large-scale national goals which will affect all spheres of our lives, including the creation of a comfortable living environment, technological leadership, economic development, and of course, digital transformation. New technology in AI are becoming a foundation for achieving those goals. They improve performance and they increase the innovation. aspect of our economy. The pace of technological development has been growing incessantly. AI technology is now a strategic resource for economy and business. We see that AI is quickly being implemented and adopted in various industries in oil and gas sector, finance, transport, retail and many other industries. It increases reliability, security, the speed of processes and ensures a brand new level of optimization. The capabilities of AI are very beneficial tomemes. Half of small businesses already adopted for practical tasks from processing information to content generation. In addition, AI plays a vital role in governance. It allows processing data much more efficiently. It allow it provides for a much more efficient document flow. For example, the Max robot on the go portal has been expanding the range of tasks that it can handle by itself in a very user-friendly manner. AI improves performance with low unemployment. Technology is what becomes the key driver of growth. wide adoption of AI is observed in experimental legal regimes. It is a great environment for experimenting with all kinds of new regulation models. Transport is a good successful use case. 95% of large companies have recognized AI as an absolutely necessary condition for strategic development. 83% of top managers say that generative AI is creating new value for the client. Leading companies that have been adopting AI at scale demonstrate 15 to 20% growth in sales. They reduce the time to market from 5 to 6 months to 1 to two months. Russia today is one of the leaders in global digitization by creating the environment for efficient use of AI in the interests of",

Russia today is one of the leaders in global digitization by creating the environment for efficient use of AI in the interests of As the president said yesterday at the plenary session, it is crucial to be moving forward continuously in order to meet all of the challenges of modernity and the rapidly changing world. The goal now is for Russia to become one of the leaders in the development of AI. We want to expedite the adoption of this technology in all areas of economy and we also want to foster talent for the industry. By 2030 the contribution of AI technology in GDP should exceed 11 trillion rubles. A significant portion of that effect will be accounted for by generative solutions. Also yesterday the president announced that generative AI needs to be applied across all kinds of regions in Russia in all key industries by 2030 and also in most governance and management processes together with business. The new goal is to implement the program of creating data centers for developing AI Such data centers need to be accessible for research centers and technology companies. The creation of these data centers will become will lay the groundwork for new jobs in highly promising sectors. Special emphasis is placed on the scientific basis for the development of technology. As the president said, Russia cannot afford dependence on foreign suppliers in terms of AI. This means that Russia needs to have its own suits of hardware and software for the development of AI, which means we will be supporting all kinds of research and development effort efforts in AI. 13 research centers already take advantage of federal grants. They create a network of expertise. They've been creating domestically AI models and solutions for actual real tasks and they also generate talent. We see that in that there is return on investment. This is why the government will continue with these support measures. We have finalized a competitive selection of universities that will be providing specialists and experts across different disciplines for the AI industry. Starting this year, the training will begin using the new educational methodologies and by 2030, we will have more than 10,000 graduates that will specialize in AI. A critical factor in the development of AI is power security, energy security. Over the past 10 years, , over the next 10 years, data centers will start consuming three times more power, this power supply for data centers need to need needs to be reliable and uninterrupted. So the plans of data center development needs to go hand inhand with the development of the whole energy structure, energy infrastructure in Russia. For data centers, we have unique solutions in terms of power supply. We're talking about nuclear power, including smaller scale power plants. We will be introducing new facilities,",

For data centers, we have unique solutions in terms of power supply. We're talking about nuclear power, including smaller scale power plants. We will be introducing new facilities, and offshore ones. And this will contribute largely to the development of the data center program. We need to usher in new technological digital transformation. There is a gap between the companies that are widely adopting AI and those who are not. And this gap will only be increasing. The winners will be the ones who will be faster than others in implementing AI technology in their processes and also the combination of human and AI. We do not want to replace humans. We want to create an environment where technology improves human potential, liberates people from routine and supports them in their c creativity. Russian specialists are working on this hard, including the ones here at Spare. I'm sure that this forum will become a platform for productive discussions and for exchange of opinions between Russian and foreign experts. I would like to thank the biggest technology company in Russia and Mr. Graph personally for organizing this important business event. I wish all the participants of the forum helpful and informative discussions and breakthroughs in their research and development. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Novak. I know that you focus a lot on international cooperation and I know that based on the presidential decision last year an AI alliance was established over 2025 we have delivered a a book of AI use cases. It will be available for download. use cases concerning Russia and BRICS countries. yesterday we have expanded the alliance and I'm very happy to give you this very first edition. Thank you very much. I know that we now have 25 members. So the alliance is expanding. That's true. Dear friends, welcome to day two of the conference. We've garnered 30 million views out of 170 countries yesterday over the first day of the conference. usually these numbers are only growing. and yesterday we had this record-breaking number. Mr. Putin spoke a lot about the practical use cases of AI and this is important not just for the state but for each and every business. Mr. Novak in his opening speech also gave some facts and figures and when we were exploring the stands the exhibition Mr. was constantly asking questions how do you do this how does it work in practice and all that I mean theory is great but the the practical hands-on experience something that brings real practical value is something that we will be discussing today in day two of the conference solutions clearly have a positive impact on our clients on their comfort on their on the returns that we get as an organization.

In addition to product related solutions and use cases and practical cases from Russian businesses, we will also hear from foreign experts from different countries, India, China. We've brought experts from the US, Turkey, Bahrain, Oman and many other countries. So stay tuned. We will have several parallel tracks. and a very interesting program. Right after the opening, we'll have a section with the bricks countries and members of AI of the AI alliance. We will talk about the case book that Mr. Novak is holding and in the second part of the day we will have a session of the Russian alliance of AI where we will talk about the problems. You know we often focus too much on successes and it might sound difficult to believe in. it may sound like well everyone else is succeeding and I'm not but A journey in AI is a a a journey of trials and tribulations very often of not just successes but failures as well problems as well and we have decided within the alliance that we will be frank with each other in terms of challenges and problems that we've overcome or are only trying to overcome. So I expect a very lively and interesting discussion. A big topic is efforts in experience exchange, expertise exchange among researchers, scientists, young scientists as well. We have this special event called AIG deep dive where we have direct one-on-one talks and different exhibition booths that you can explore and talk to different people. It's a very friendly atmosphere there. So, you're very much invited there as well. And at the end of the day, leaders of AI will receive awards. We'll have an awards ceremony for the best use cases in the development of AI in Russia. Once again, welcome. And we're kicking off with the second day of the conference full on the moderator and the presenter of the conference, Virika Ramanovam.

We have a guest that is going to connect through video call the CEO of Sino Ventures and Cyn AI privilege to share my thoughts to the AI anniversary special occasion. I've been working on AI for over 40 years and I've never been excited like like the last three years. The advent of generative AI is something that will change the world. Generative AI has delivered to us more and more powerful foundation models that goes from text, image, video understanding and many many applications are emerging. The capabilities of these models are improving month by month and it is not stopping and also the cost of inference is coming down about 10 times per year. So that means whatever AI wasn't good enough this year it will be good enough next year and if it's not cheap enough it will be cheap enough next year. But I'm most excited about AI agents because these models are able to inference and do reasoning. The agents are then endowed with those capabilities because agents use large language models as their brain. But agent does more than that. An agent takes a command or request from a user, decomposes into step-by-step instructions and executes these instructions by running applications or websites on PCs and phones. So, it is really just like a super smart human employee who can also take on a task that maybe it h he or she hasn't even seen before and deliver results. these agents are getting smarter and smarter and they will transform the future of corporations because if you think about an agent that does the job of screening resumes, another agent does the job of scheduling interviews, another agent does the job of making an offer. Altogether these agents will work together to become a recruiting agent and other HR functions will also become agents for example performance review. And when all these agents start to work together, we can imagine a day where the performance evaluation agent will give guidance to the recruiting agent so that the people doing well become role models to to recruit against the employees who are not doing so well. The recruiting agent will reduce the interest in hiring people like them in the future. So that that will continue to improve and you can imagine just like putting Lego pieces together from recruiting agent, interview agent, hiring agent to the HR agent. Then the HR agent will will work with the marketing agent and the product agent and the technology agent and that will transform the future of corporation where today the fundamental unit is a human employee but eventually the fundamental unit will primarily be AI agents. Of course there will be people who supervise these agents. this will become an incredible way to create value because when all these agents work",

        "text": "will transform the future of corporation where today the fundamental unit is a human employee but eventually the fundamental unit will primarily be AI agents. Of course there will be people who supervise these agents. this will become an incredible way to create value because when all these agents work politics, no miscommunication and every agent knows everything. So even the marketing agent understands technology. Imagine a future company with these workers who are effectively omnisient who work together seamlessly to create value. These agents will improve the companies not just in cost savings but in improving fundamental KPIs for companies in delivering outcomes for companies in improving companies revenue and also profits. So in the future the competition among companies will be such that the company that has the best agent to start and collects data and uses that data to teach the agent in a flying wheel. It to the extent that the company can build that closed loop the company will become the best company in the industry. So industry leaders and entrepreneurs really need to embrace AI, think about how to do everything with AI and ex and start developing AI agents to do to build not just the lowhanging fruit agents in the company but think about how this Lego future multi- aents will transform the company organization be the fundamental part of the strategy for the company and this kind of revolution must happen at the founder, chairman, CEO level. A VP or division manager can certainly use AI to improve his or her job and his or her division. But companies built from the ground up or transformed completely where the CEO is the driver of the transformation will be one that achieves the most in this generative AI revolution. Thank you. A round of applause please. Thank you for such a great motivational real implementation product announcements and the financial effect calculations. let's keep to the schedule and have a productive day on in the evening we have a we will have a special event u on AI and just try to test drive and think how to use AI solutions for your business and think about how the new developments can be used in your processes and how can they pave the way for the future and right now we are moving to the next international business forum bricks plus on AI as part of AI journey in 2025 the time of those who do no talk more integrations. So companies and leaders are here that get the e economic effect from using AI. the key event of the forum is the launch of the international of platform bricks plus AI success hub. the trusted cases from bricks plus countries and the readym made models that are ready for scaling and implementation.

The business forum on AI became the platform to unite the practices and the leaders that actually do implement these solutions, the practical solutions that do not just do theory. They scale cutting edge solutions with AI. The participants of the forum shared the experience of implementing AI in the production processes and the industry and discuss the vectors of the transatlantic transboarder international cooperation.

Ajit Abraham, , professor, vice chancellor of Sai University friends. Hello. As you can see, we have a very high level and representative panel, fantastic, exciting guests. And we decided to talk about the applications of AI. And everyone is going to talk about their success stories and maybe failures as well. You know, I've said before that when I opened the day with Mr. Novak that we were so excited about the success stories that we might have forgotten the challenges related to AI integrations that everyone faces. I would like to say a few words about ZBUR and then give the floor to all of the other participants. We are going to ask them how they can how they are implementing AI. What is their story? We are going to speak either English or Russian or other languages. But I think I will ask questions maybe in Russian and in English. But I think I mean there simultaneous interpretation. So anyway, a few words about ZBAR. just you know quick notes for our international audience. Last day 172 countries 30 million viewers. So a pretty big audience. Now a couple of words about Zur.

We are the largest acquirer in the world in terms of the bank transactions and bank cards processing despite all the challenges that we face right now. Now what do we mean when we say AI native vision of Zur? Obviously we are talking about hyperpersonalization around every customer and every customer is absolutely unique. Everyone who is watching this here on online totally unique and the task of Zur is to create an ecosystem around every person and to provide the services and the products that they need right now. This is what we called humanentric approach and without AI obviously this is absolutely not achievable. But when we say AI, obviously we're talking about generative AI as B has a LLM that is called Giga Chat. Herman graph yesterday mentioned it many times and talked in detail about it. there will be major releases in open source as well. We have Kandinski model that generates images and videos. But it's not the model that was created for the sake of the model. It was the model created for the sake of our customers and Giga Pro, Giga Max, Ultra. the range of the models. Today these models are going to be introduced in greater detail. What are the practical applications? right now we have more than 500 cases of AI implementations in Zur. it's pretty challenging but we are successfully addressing the challenges that we face. the gen AI target effect is 50 billion rubles in 2025 as it is expected and we appreciate the fact that Genai gives us direct benefits from the implementation. On the slides you can see pretty ambitious figures. So I'm not going to read them out to save time. But there is no process in ZBR. I'm not even talking about the bank but about the entire ZBA group where AI would not drive some value. Sometimes it's 10% increase of value, sometimes 50, 100 or sometimes we're talking about the many fold effects. Kandinski, it's our model with the Russian code so to speak. And obviously is not only a bank, it's an active participant of an AI alliance. the heads the the the chairman of the supervisory boards are rotated.

We decided to create an AI success hub together with Yido and we're going to talk about that a bit later. This hub helps to find solutions tailored for you. I would ask to launch a video. Yes, that's that's the video. , basically it just uses the prompts the prompts that you that that are pretty pretty standard. You can find the cases that you need to address your specific business task and you can select the case that is tailored for you that is in line with your ambitions and u I would ask you to use this I invite you to use this this hub it's an international it's a collection of international cases international experience. Please leverage that opportunity. This is I think it for Burr. I would like to thank Mitri Kun as a representative of Yunido who has helped us a lot and he also organized the platform for all of these things to happen. Eager, please you have the floor. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. First of all, let me express my sincere gratitude to the organizers Burr and its partners for hosting this international forum AI journey that has become a unique platform for discussing the future of AI and its role in the industrial development of bricks plus countries. For me as the head of the UNIDO center in Russia, it is a big honor to speak here on behalf of the United Nations industrial development organization, a structure that for more than 50 years has been helping countries turn industrial ambitions into inclusive, sustainable and technologically oriented outcomes. It is great to talk about our success stories and next steps. Today we mark an important event as you know we are launching the BRICS plus AI success hub. It's an international platform for sharing AI use cases in bricks plus countries. On behalf of our organization, I would like to emphasize that we sincerely welcome the creation of this platform and we are pleased to contribute practically to its development in terms of real industrial solutions tested in UNITO projects in different regions of the world. And these are not just theoretical examples but technologies that have already proven their effectiveness from automating production lines to applying machine learning in the agricultural sector in industrial monitoring systems.

        "text": "the world. And these are not just theoretical examples but technologies that have already proven their effectiveness from automating production lines to applying machine learning in the agricultural sector in industrial monitoring systems. Our platform is of key importance for several reasons. First, it makes successful solutions visible and it applicability in specific production conditions. Second, it lowers the information barrier for small and medium-sized businesses, those enterprises that often lack access to knowledge about modern technology and best practices adopted by their competitors for example or colleagues. And finally, this initiative creates conditions for replication when a successful case in India for instance can inspire a company in Russia or Brazil to implement a similar solution but a solution that will be adapted to their own tasks. Our contribution to this platform is based on three key areas of UNIDO work. The first one is regulatory and intellectual leadership. UNIDO participates in the development of the UN global digital compact and it helps countries formulate practical actionable strategies in the field of AI. We see our job as ensuring that the principles of responsible and inclusive AI find real expression in the national policies of different states. The second stream is international partnership platforms such as AIM Global and the BRICS center for industrial competencies. AIM [snorts] Global brings together over 200 participants including ministries, technology leaders, universities and development banks. Meanwhile, the BRIC center for industrial competencies established under the mandate of the industrial ministers of BRICS countries facilitates the exchange of technology, development of competencies and acceleration of digital transformation of industry in BRICS plus countries. Third is the practical implementation of projects in more than 700 current unido projects. We see how digital solutions help modernize production, increase labor productivity, reduce costs, and expand sales markets. One of the recent examples is in Namibia, AI helps analyze huge arrays of data, including satellite imagery, to increase the yield of farms. And this is just one of dozens of similar use cases where AI becomes really helpful. And four is partnership with the corporate sector. When we were preparing for this event, we asked ourselves an important question. What value does business truly gain by participating in such initiatives? For the largest companies, this means access to new markets and new geographies. UNIDO provides platforms or or centers of excellence in more in more than 10 countries with separate offices and generally in more than 170 countries. These centers of excellence help companies test their solutions and present them to ministries and industrial agencies of partner countries. Second, working with the next generation of engineers. This is where young specialists learn to use digital twins, robotic systems, control systems and they essentially become ambassadors of this technology. They help their own countries to adopt them. Third is strengthening international positioning. Participation in sustainable development initiatives enhances a company's status as a responsible technology leader. Small and medium-sized businesses. Businesses can gain access to",

Third is strengthening international positioning. Participation in sustainable development initiatives enhances a company's status as a responsible technology leader. Small and medium-sized businesses. Businesses can gain access to opportunities to integrate this into their technological chains. Importantly, we also help them as I said train staff regardless of the level of maturity of the company and we also give them an opportunity to become integrators of solutions and not just their users. It is important to emphasize that AIM global the bricks center for industrial competencies and the bricks plus AI success hub platform are all parts of a single ecosystem. Aim global is the global expertise and technological vision. BRICS center is for the regional needs and focus on competencies and applied tasks of the group countries. And the bricks plus AI success hub platform is the bridge between them. The place where in demand technologies meet the real demands of economies. Today as we have the first cases already uploaded to the platform. I would like to invite Russian and international technology leaders to post their solutions more actively and I encouragememes to use the platform as a handbook of practical approaches that can be implemented as early as tomorrow. Let me also note that on November 23rd at the UNIDO General Conference in Riyad, we will present the new platform to the international community and we will be talking about cooperation with ZBA and Russian partners. We see growing interest from member states in the best practices of BRICS plus countries and we call on them to join the new platform. Colleagues, today we are not talking about the potential of AI but about its proven effectiveness. The new international platform for sharing AI use cases in bricks plus countries is a step towards making the technologies of the future accessible today. UNIDO is ready to support this process through regulation setting through partnership platforms and through real projects on the ground. I invite all of you to join the efforts in developing industrial solutions, scaling best practices and creating a digital future that will be inclusive, reliable and sustainable in the interests of all bricks plus countries. Thank you. [snorts] Thank you, Mr. Kjun. when we talk about AI, the first thing that comes to mind is of course this race between the US and China. As I see it, China has been winning this race in many respects. Speaking of publications, for example, 33% onethird of all research papers on AI in 2024 were papers written by scientists from China. In 2020, that number was only 20%. So we see this sharp increase and we also see that China has a lot of platforms for developing AI.

Shanghai AI research institute is one of the major platforms in China for developing AI not just in China but around the Miss Yanjinglu from Shanghai AI Research Institute the CBC Secretary. So what I'm interested in is how you do research because research doesn't always translate into commercial use but then again you need to make money to make profit. How do you commercialize AI solutions AI developments? Why is that important? Because we often say well let's be practical and someone else will do the research and then we do not have enough to invest in the research and that's that's where it ends with the practice. But China does research very well and does practical use very well. How do you combine the two? Thank you very much Mr. Vidyahin. good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I am very happy to be here on this platform discussing how AI has been reshaping our world. I would like to begin my speech today with a painting. This painting was created in 2019 by professors from the central academy of fine arts commissioned by our institutes and sense time. It took a year of field research to complete this work. It's called artificial intelligence 2019. It depicts the long way of AI development. It's modeled after the map of the Yanzi River Delta uvial plane and it combines the history, present and future imagination of AI. At the origin we see that there are three tributaries number theory, information theory and assembly language converging into the river of the Dartmouth conference where the concept of AI was first established globally through long-term evolution. AI has progressed from early supervised learning to today's deep learning and from knowledge graphs to intelligent control training. As a result, as we see in this painting, we can see the chip giant island featuring familiar names like Intel, Samsung, Qualcomm, and Nvidia. The artist includes a political metaphor here as well. On the far right there is this isolated island called Huawei hinting at the politically motivated pressure that Huawei faces. However, the artist gives this idea that Huawei will be able to overcome this. But let's turn to China. Since 2020, China has entered a rapid development phase for large models. A cohort of general purpose large models is advancing swiftly and their applications are accelerating their expansion beyond office productivity, daily life, and entertainment into healthcare, industry, and education. Presidents Xiinping visited Shanghai 3 months ago and gave special care on the science and technology development. During the visit, he said, , I would like to summarize this as follows. AI is the technology of the younger generation and at the same time AI needs global cooperation. China is no longer just catching up. It's innovating constantly owing to four major factors.

AI is the technology of the younger generation and at the same time AI needs global cooperation. China is no longer just catching up. It's innovating constantly owing to four major factors. Top level globally leading data resources and frameworks domestic open-source ecosystems and more importantly AI inducation and talent incubation. One example is China's breakthrough in large language models or deepseek. And now I would like to give you an outline on our institute. The Shanghai AI Institute was established in 2019 by the municipal government and Shanghai Jaoong University. this initiative aims to implement major national decisions and developments and deployments on AI development serving as an innovation platform to advance the innovationdriven development strategy. SARI focuses on original innovation in foundational AI technology breakthroughs in core application technology, R&D and industrial translation as well as talent cultivation and industrial ecosystem development. It has become an influential new type R&D institution in China. Focused on full chain innovation paradigm leading standard setting sire employs a demanddriven R&D model guided by major scientific and engineering challenges. It has established a complete closed loop from fundamental research, technological breakthroughs, result translation, ecosystem building and industrial implementation. We have created joint laboratories with a number of companies in robotics new energy vehicles, smart healthcare, digital finance and digital government. For example, together with Costco shipping company, we established an automated terminal transportation industry R&D center to conduct research on key common technologies focusing on the major technological needs of China's automated terminals and smart ports. Also jointly with AI digital government joint joint laboratory with Kazakhstan National Information Technologies. We have been striving to build a benchmark case for digital government under the belt and road initiative. Our labs also made breakthroughs in embodied intelligence and humanoid robotics. We have developed China's first commercialized mass production factory for general robots. And so far we have trained over 1,000 robots in the factory based on comprehensive real world scenarios. We also established the world's first million scale data set and full potential hardware platform. I'll give you a close look into our robots. Heat. [music] [music] [music] Heat. Heat.

Just as UN Secretary sustainable energy so that it fuels a more sustainable future. Let us move for an AI that is shaped by all of humanity for all of humanity. On July 4th, 2024, the Global Industrial Artificial Intelligence Alliance Center of Excellence was officially launched at the opening ceremony of the World Artificial Intelligence Conference and the high level meeting on global governance. The Minister of Industry and Information Technology and the Director General of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization were jointly inaugurated. Positioned as a crucial hub for international scientific and tech technological innovation, the global AI center of excellence is dedicated to building a core platform for global AI governance, technology application, and industrial acceleration. In his meeting with Gutish, President Xiinping also emphasized that China supports the United Nations in playing a leading role in advancing the reform of the international financial architecture and the global governance of AI. The center is jointly operated by Shanghai AI Research Institute and the United Nations Department of Digital Transformation and Artificial Intelligence Strategy. We also opened a center of use cases in customs for BRICS countries. We encourage all of you to participate in their work. This center as I said is jointly operated by Shanghai AI research institute and the UN department of digital transformation and AI strategy. It is positioned as an international AI guest room and global AI industrial accelerator. We provide services to international organizations, government bodies, research institutes, industry and enterprise to form a healthy AI ecosystem for global economic and social development. We have now connected with nearly 20 countries and regions. Here is a glimpse of some partners across the world. And I would like to extend our sincere invitation to the guests here today to join our network and work together for a more collaborative future in the field of AI. AI is here to empower not replace. China is proud to stand alongside the global community, sharing knowledge, setting standards, and innovating for a future where technology serves humanity. Thank you. Let's build that future together. [applause] Thank you very much, Madame Lu Yansin. It would be great to see this AI map right now, you know, like in 2025. Did Did you try to have this map to to paint this map for 2025? Yes, I think that actually next year we're going to do that.

Yeah, I wish you do that. There will be a separate island maybe a continent that will be responsible for the ROI on AI. It's a huge hype. I think the the the market is overheated. Stargate $500 billion. Invest AI in EU 200 billion euros. It's like u multiple trillion investments. 1 trill200 billion and while the income is like 500 800 not even the profits that's the ROI on gen generative AI now those who do those who are engaged in AI and right now obviously we there's more and more investments in AI increasingly more investments and this is a big challenge not only for the developers not only of developers of LLMs but but those who use AI but obviously for investors who well invest in AI entrepreneurs we have Martin Khauser here with us and I would like to ask him how to transform the AI developments in real and valuable solutions for companies. What investors think about that? How do you select that? Because now you can write AI somewhere in the presentation whether you have it or not your market cap will grow dramatically. So how do do you choose the companies that you want to invest in and how do you make sure that these companies perform well and how your participants in your portfolio how they get the proper value from the AI I've been investing as an angel investor in Europe but for the last two or three years I'm investing in Russia. because we very much believe in a round of applause here for Martin. Thank you. We very much believe in in startups made in Russia. And I was honored by the way one month ago on the spare startup summit. I was honored to be the most active angel investor in Russia in 25 and accordingly next step we are now setting up a fund which is called Chuck VC. We are investing in AI startups in seed phase. we're setting up right now but the deals flow has already started and for today's sessions I have checked that we've we've analyzed like 220 startups within the last month and I was wondering what they are doing what they actually doing and I want to share this with you 10% are working on process acceleration 10% aimed on cost optimization 20% targeted forecasting and analytics and 50% % focus on automation. So the key insight is clear automation stands out. It brings measurable results and it's reducing routine work so people can focus on more creative tasks. So what makes AI startups succeed?

It brings measurable results and it's reducing routine work so people can focus on more creative tasks. So what makes AI startups succeed? I want to point out three factors. The whole world is now watching it. Startups is seeking for startups that are vertical AIs. It means you have to understand who is your client. It's maybe experts, maybe SMB, it's maybe corporates. You should focus on geography on industry and of course on the right delivery model. So you maybe can quickly set up a SAS model. But if you work with corporates they want on premise and that's a very different story. a very different focus. So the second thing is step-by-step integration. What does it mean? If you start with pilot projects, you have to identify real business pains and you have to spend a lot of time and resources on UX means if you have the best application in the world but the end user doesn't understand or doesn't like it, you have no chance. So this is one of the key points I really want to focus here. AI from start startups isn't sold. It's proven in small steps. This is very important. Tell this to all the founders out there because they think I have the nicest product. Everybody should like it just like me. But no, they will like it if they understand it and they love it and they will use it if you integrate in small steps. So that's the second point. the 30s you have to understand and survive survive vision the the the full business deal cycle. What does it mean? You come up with a nice product but you have to show resilience because very often startups don't understand the processes in corporates means you have a nice product but you have to prove that's a nice product and you have to fulfill all technical requirements. You should see the eyes of startupers when the corporate points out that there are more than 300 requirements and you have to fulfill it or you go. So you have to have resilience also in financial terms which means you have to partners who finance what you're doing until the real flows from corporate start. So this is like maybe sounds like very theoretical. give you two specific examples from my portfolio. First one is in HR. You know in recruiting you have very very different processes and you know recruiters are those guys who open their browser and they have like hundreds of tabs open because they're looking for the right people. So these startups Russian rooted founder they automated short listing of candidates. What does it mean? You need for example a C++ programmer, 5 years experience, some other requirements. He should know English, whatever. And you open a chopboard, maybe LinkedIn or some",

You need for example a C++ programmer, 5 years experience, some other requirements. He should know English, whatever. And you open a chopboard, maybe LinkedIn or some having set these requirements, you get hundreds or thousands of hits. So these guys have invented a tool that makes short listing means this person fits 98% this person 97 and so on. And why I'm telling you all this because in order to come up with a let's say MVP plus very interesting instrument it took more than one and a half years no turnover but you want you want to to eat you you need some housing you one and a half years somebody has to finance you and after this one more year to refine UX means to make it fit that people really love to use it and using it. So these guys were like two and a half years spending on developing the instrument to make it nice and then within one month they onboarded more than 20 relevant B2B customers paying customers. from an investment point of view it's like a like a textbook story. I was the first investor then the Stockholm School of Economics took over. They supported them and after showing tractions after 2 and a half years they raised the next round 350,000 which is about three 30 million rubles and now they're doing fine. they're can can develop their product and go for more clients. So that's the first case. The second case I want to share is a Russian startup present simple AI. These guys are simplifying corporate presentations based on the brand book. what is interesting here they started as a B2C company. They had something like 700,000 registrations during first year, students, teachers, experts and then they pivoted to corporate to B2B customers which is which is not very easy because you you get a lot of technical requirements, security requirements and so on. But they did fine. this year they already realized five pilot projects. One of them we're very proud of that in spare marketing. a lot of people using there this software and from an investment point of view I was again the first angel investor believing in this idea I was introducing them to two other angel investors one just giving money other one giving expertise in the industry and network and a small fund now they have these pilots now they have the B2B tractions they're knowing they know what they're doing they are they know what they're not doing very important they are ready maybe for next step to go to bricks because it's a very interesting product not only for Russian companies and so now two two funds want to raise provide the next finance round.

And this means for investors, startups alike is surviving the real world AI deal cycle means thinking less about the size of the model. You should be very flexible in which models you use. Of course, they also using spare gighat, but they're also using Chinese models. and the very very focus should be on the problem you solve for your customers. Thank you so much. Thank you, [applause] Martin. Martin, thank you very much. I have some questions. You have questions about startups. I have questions about corporate customers. Yes, they have a different approach. But yeah, you need to discuss this concerns. Thank you very much. it was a it was a these were great remarks. Islamic Republic of Iran is our next speaker when we talk about AI and Islamic Republic of Iran. you want to learn more because you want to hear how AI is going to be developed in Iran. So Amir Hassin Mi will now have the floor is heading the AI section under the president of Iran. Please you have the floor sir. Hello everyone. Good afternoon. I'm honored to be here. it's good. I'm hired to be here today to answer your question. As I know many actions are under way in this area. Many projects, many infrastructure projects are defined in my country and are being carried out. I will mention some of them in my speech. there are plans to encourage the big domestic investors to enter the AI field in Iran and also we're taking steps to encourage the AI economy e ecosystem including universities startups [clears throat] mediumsiz companies and also bigger ones and also we have programs to foster our AI education system to have more and more scientists and professionals in AI. Definitely cooperation with other countries will speed up our plan and our actions to reach the goal. Let's get started today. when we talk about artificial intelligence, it's easy to get lost in a sea of fear. Fear of job losses, control, inequality, and exclusion. And some of those fears are not unfounded. We are also we have already seen concerning uses of AI from autonomous weapons killing tens of people at a time to a content generation engines used in propaganda from recommendation algorithms optimized to narrow our thinking for engagement and profit to platforms that harvest personal data. under the guise of smart services. And perhaps most troubling of them, we",

And perhaps most troubling of them, we of AI safety and ethics is being misused, used as a justification to centralize power and limit open innovation. But the future cannot be built on fear alone. We must go beyond these concerns and actively shape a better plan. One grounded in wisdom, openness, and shared purpose. Because when guided by ethics, empathy, and human intention, AI can became can become one of the humanity's most powerful lies. It can help us understand our past by processing vast historical data and revealing lessons that can inform better decisions. It can help us understand history's complex patterns. It allows us to learn from the mistakes of those who came before us, ensuring we are not doomed to repeat them. It can depend our resistant understanding of the world around us. Uncovering patterns in science, nature, and society that were previously invisible. Opening new windows into the complexity and wonder of our universe. It can help us understand ourselves by revealing our moral blind spots, recognizing patterns in our behavior and guiding us toward greater self-awareness. It can make us more conscious of God's blessings and encourage us to live gratefully, respect the rights of others, and care for the environment and all living beings. It can amplify human capabilities like creativity, inspiring artists, assisting writers and fueling innovation not by reflecting imagination but by extending its boundaries. And perhaps most importantly, it can bring us closer together through real time translation, cultural understanding, and the building of empathy across borders. All of this suggests AI could lead us to deeper, more purposeful lives, not merely longer or easier ones. As Tolto is often quoted as saying that the meaning of life is not in living but in living noly. Of course it is an English translation but the message remains powerful. In the country I represent. We are pursuing this positive path through a number of national initiatives. One of our most important projects is the development of a national AI platform, a unified environment where engineers, researchers, and data professionals can develop models, algorithms, and intelligence products with speed, security, and efficiency. This platform simplifies development ensuring access to shared tools and workflows and supports high performance computing at a scale. Another major initiative focuses on AI powered assistance across government institutions. This seems these systems are being designed to support dialogue with laws and regulations. Streamline administrative process processes and provide intelligent recommendations for polic policy makers all aligned with institutual policies and national priorities. Ultimately, they will be integrated into a unified government assistant framework to deliver a smart, consistent, and human- centered public services.

These projects use predictive analytics and datadriven modeling to support long-term sustainable development. But perhaps our most valuable asset is our community of experts, researchers, and young talents in AI. A generation committed to building a smarter and more equitable future. And today in this international gathering I would like to extend a clear invitation. Let us identify and build pathways to collaboration in sharing highquality data in co-developing models and frameworks and in setting joint goals for intelligent products that address our specific shared challenges in bricks plus countries. Let us move beyond fragmented efforts and work toward a future where artificial intelligence is not a tool for power but for humane. Let us choose the right path together. Thank you. [applause] Thank you very much. We will be very interested in following the development of AI in Iran. As we know, Iran has very good, very solid education in mathematics and computer science. , I've visited Tehran recently and I was very happy to meet some of the experts there. We wish you every success and I hope you will count on our expertise as well. Thank you. And next our guest from Brazil, Ronaldo dash Santos, our good friend, he is back for his second AI journey. I think Brazilia in terms of remoteness, geographical remoteness at least. I think it's the the farthest country from Moscow out to those represented here. But in terms of AI adoption, it is one of the leaders. In fact, interesting figures. When I was preparing for the panel session, I saw that in just the past year plus 2 million Brazilian companies started using AI. That means roughly three companies every minute. I think that's that's the estimate. and also more than 9 million enterprises in Brazil already have already adopted AI in one way or another. So I have this question for for Mr. Dos Santos. What is helping you adopt AI in Brazil in such a large scale and what are the main success stories for this technology? Why does everyone want this technology? Okay, thank you Mr. Alexander Vidyahim. Thank you their friends that are listening to me here now the public present the panelists and Brazil has indeed invested quite a lot in in AI you know that Brazil today at the very same time we are here now in Brazil the COP 30 is going on there in Brazil I don't know if you know about that we are discussing in Brazil about our most important thing that's the legacy we have received from the past that's our natural resources and u so I bring you warm greetings",

So I'd like to teach you a new word a Portuguese word that is much. Could could you friends repeat with me this word much? Can you say that? Yeah. You know, is a Brazilian word that comes from our culture. When for example in Brazil have to build up a house in a village that somebody doesn't have enough resources, they get the friends together and they make the much to come together and build a house. And very soon, very quickly, we can do that. Much is more than a task force. It's more than cooperation. is more than union or a collaboration. It is a concept that that takes the ingredients of all these words that I said and puts on or adds synergy creating a model of cooperation while where peers fool each other with energy strength and I tell you the results is amazing is great and Brazil implemented this much there in the COP 30 to put countries together for a purpose that's good for all of us. I I I in Brazil I'm president of this association called a mest one entity that practices the muid technology. We bring to the same table government, telecom operators, airports, ports, agri business, banks, academia and professionals and we discuss technology creating a catalyst environment for across select for across sectors relationship and we promote understanding solving problems and innovating solutions. Regarding AI, we have had the joy to see in Brazil a promising future indeed because of two things. First the Brazilian government, sec and second the private sector. As you said in Brazil we are around 26 million companies and from them 9 million are using now as the number you said Alexander 9 million companies are using today artificial intelligence. Every minute three companies are coming are joining AI in many areas. In Brazil, our government has created a plan called Brazilian plan for AI. a plan of investment of 23 billion Brazilian reis or something like 4.5 billions US dollars for the next three years to promote a leap in the usage of AI in Brazil paraphrasing a Brazilian song of Gerald Vandre that says who knows makes the time does not wait it to happen.

That is the plan I told you PBIA which will make available to the inter interested parties. If you want to know about that afterwards I can send to you more details papers regarding this where we can show the opportunities in the country. We are acting in infrastructure like big data centers. You know Brazil has a clean system of production electrical energy. Then we have a tremendous power for for a data center legislation, education and we are paving the future and promoting AI for good of all as our president in Brazil likes to say. And the the results do not stop with the government. Our private market is at full step. As I said, 40% of our private companies are using already it. The majority sees great benefits. a research a recent research made the those companies are saying that they have seen one increase of 30% in their profit. So they are investing more and more in the usage of AI but basically they using AI Brazil for customer services. we are not integrating that deeper and that's there is where we see many possibilities to to go deep more than just the relationship with customers but use AI for development of products to put it in the engine of the companies that we can really really increase the profits of company. a significant portion of those companies faces or faces a major major shortage that is the specialized AI professionals. 46% of them says we need more professionals in Brazil. So we are looking for partners to increase part partnerships in education with our university. Brazil wants to relate to all countries in a multilateral way, doing business, respecting sovereignties and warranty our own sovereignty. Issues such the storage of Brazilian data and also the development of one LLM in Portuguese and Spanish that incorporates our regional knowledge, our central objectives for Latin America and also for Brazil. We want therefore to open the doors for business and partnerships aligned with the this concept. Together we can make a global multi round where everyone wins with the final focus of achieving the beneficial AI for all.

But I don't think in Russian we have a similar concept, a similar word. But we did have this tradition.

And as for Turkey, I used to live in Turkey for about 3 years. I lived in Turkey in Istanbul and I worked next to where Mr. Johnson works. when we were preparing for the session, we had this brief discussion with him and I have great fond memories about that time in Istanbul in Turkey. I'm very happy to give the floor to Mr. Cineimly to talk about the development of AI in Turkey. What are the success stories there, use cases there? Mr. Ciney is the head of the association that unites 400 AI startups, Turkish companies, and he is the point of contact on AI in Turkey. Please, you have the floor. Dear Alexander Vyakin, thank you very much for the lovely introduction and inviting me. hello everyone, this is John Camel. I I am bringing you warm regards from IstAnul. let's go back to your question. Yeah, thank you. Let's go back to your question. let's talk about let's discuss about AI integration challenges, realities and some guidelines in Turkey. Except for the top 300 400 companies there is almost no data driven structuring within firms. the the culture of being data oriented has not yet matured. there is a data although the data exist it is not organized or nor clean. So there is a lot of things there there is a lot of ground works to do that means it's a it's a challenging transformation journey which requires investments and unless the top management of companies support and sponsors the AI projects AI initiatives these projects fall short or fail oftenly and we face furthermore we face difficulties in strictly restrictor regulation for example in health care sector in banking insurance energy sector we have strict regulations for example you cannot use public data even though you will use it anonymously. it is forbidden to use public data for health sector for example or you cannot use",

Second is to build develop and strengthen the AI ecosystem. we have variety of services and events for this. For example, we have TRI acade academy, TRAI consulting services. we provide some recommendations like gold standards. We we we telling them to develop strategy. It it means align AI strategy with parallel in parallel with your main corporate strategy. and also you have to choose carefully use cases a identify the most relevant and the high priority use cases. Here for the mediumsiz company we go further to help them. We are telling them we are asking them to provide their business processes department departmentally they have they the mediumsize or smalls size companies doesn't have AI teams or you know business analytics or data scientists so they have to focus with limited source ources. so we we we want them to focus on their department departmental based bottlenecks pain points in order to gain quick wins that will boost their moral and achieve success and get experience. By doing this we are offering ecosystem stakeholders I mean Turkish AI startups we will connect them they will use their expertise without needing without the need of creating teams first of all after having after being successful on this projects they may build up their team by simultaneously in investing in training and development of their team. we are also guiding them to to finalize their project and get results because you know after the MIT research Gartner research 80% 90% of projects are failing or falling short. so in order to be success you have to you have to follow some guidelines. we say that's kind of golden standards and we are there to help them.

This is something I wanted to discuss with him. Africa is a very fastly growing continent. We're talking about the northern part of Africa, the central part of Africa as well, growing very rapidly. What are the challenges for the AI solution development in Africa? What are the practical solutions are applicable in this continent? It would be great to hear your thoughts. Hello. Thank you, Mr. Alexander. I'm honored to be here in the for the second edition of AI journey and I want to to present the federation because I",

I'm honored to be here in the for the second edition of AI journey and I want to to present the federation because I the federation of ICT sector private sector in Morocco and also the president of the fedition of African digital businesses that's the organization private sector ICT that we are connected with some African brothers to share best experience talking about that like this subject AI cyber security. So when we talk about artificial intelligent for Africa, people often imagine a distant future. In reality, the vision the future is already here [clears throat] at least partially across our countries. We see four types of actor moving at the same times. Our techmemes and startup for us it's very important this definition. Startups for us is explorator of innovation. some companies that's going someplace that nobody go but takememes that's the builder of digital that's is very important for us to distinguish these two actors and we have also infrastructure operators and also government and public administrations moving through digital transformations and finally a whole layer of traditionalmemes ies that are only beginning to enter the digital economy. What we are trying to build in Morocco and Africa across Africa is a true AI ecosystem that connects all these actors. But to do this, we must be honest about the challenge. The first reality where data is ready AI moves fast in sentient country and ministries major companies and infrastructure operators the situation is clear as my colleague Mr. K has told in Turkey processes are already digitized data exists it's rel relatively clean and structured so in this environment AI has been integrated quickly to optimize operations automat improve citizens or customer services enhance security or plan infrastructure better where data exists AI is not a concept It's a productivity engine. The second reality without digitalization. AI is useless. If data is not collected, if it's not structured, there is no point talking about AI. So AI will not compensate of for the absence of system or processes. On the contrary, it will amplify disorder or inefficiency. So for allmemes, the first level of economic de development is not doing AI. It's first to digitize properly, structure their operations and start collecting data consistently. sales, inventory, logistics, customers, transactions. Our core challenge is data challenge, not AI buzzword challenge. The third reality as your president has told yesterday the sovereignty where do our models run and who control the data. So if all AI capabilities depend on sutures outside our borders then we face a serious issue of digital sovereignty. Two principle and no are are nonnegotiable. AI mo models must be able to run on local or regional data centers under governance frameworks we control. Strategic and sensitive data must be stored on infrastructure subject to our own laws.",

AI mo models must be able to run on local or regional data centers under governance frameworks we control. Strategic and sensitive data must be stored on infrastructure subject to our own laws. just like energy or raw materials. Africa does not produce GPUs. So our ability to secure supply and to build the energy capacity required to power them will directly determine our our place in the AI economy. And the fourth reality energy fiber bandwidth the infrastructure behind AI the Africa continent is a big continent is not like some continent is a very big some country has more than 5,000 6,000 to to to to do fiber so AI requires stable and significant electricity robust data center and high capacity telecommunications and frau AI is not just compute it's also the ability to move massive amounts of data quickly if we want AI to benefit to the whole continent not just a few capital we need to develop the fund fundamental infrastructure energy connectivity data center and crossborder digital corridors so my conclusion is Africa should not become a simple consumer from market for AR solution but elsewhere with the right infrastructure data governance and investment in talent and digitalizations can become a co-producer of AI with its own priorities and development models. Thank you very much. [applause] Thank you very much. our last speaker Ajit Abraham. Those who were present yesterday at our event, those who were watching it online have seen how Ajit was answering the questions of Mr. Graph and Mr. Buddhen. Very exciting answers, very exciting insights. Ajit, I have a different question for you. How do you resolve the problems with talents? [snorts] Because human resources talent is the major factor of success and lack of success for AI implementations. So you as a professor, what are your take? What is your take on that? Thank you. Thank you, Alexander. It's a great honor for me to address this bricks forum. as an academician today I will not talk about AI or technology. I guess we have the whole day for tomorrow talking about various aspects. Today I want to make an appeal or a call to all the members present here. As our member from Brazil talked about mucho, we need a mucho in a very big way among all nations, all countries from bricks, bricks plus to AI alliance, network members which is expanding at a very big scale. I guess all of us are doing much in our own way in our own culture in our own countries solving our own problems. But it solves more of our challenging problems facing the world. For example, from climate change, renewable energy, looking at human defined sustainable development goals like poverty, justice, equality, life underwater, life above water, green energy.

For example, from climate change, renewable energy, looking at human defined sustainable development goals like poverty, justice, equality, life underwater, life above water, green energy. We have to work as a team. It's not just facing our own nations as well as the planet at large. So today I want to highlight one of our most transformative frontiers. It's a great opportunity AI and the critical need for deeper scientific cooperation among brick plus nations in its development and various applications. AI is no longer an isolated discipline. It is a shared ecosystem, one that demands coordinated research, ethical alignment and collective innovation. bricks bricks plus countries already represent more than 40% of the global population and a rapidly expanding share of global R&D investment. By pulling our scientific capabilities, we can craft an AI landscape that is inclusive, adaptable, and responsible. At the heart of this cooperation lie shared laboratories and join research infrastructures. Imagine crossber AI hubs where scientists from Sao Paulo, Shangghai, Ptoria, Moscow and New Delhi plus other cities in other alliance network countries work together on generative AI models, medical imaging, agit media and variety of challenges. ing problems facing our society. Joined intellectual property frameworks can protect innovation while ensuring equitable benefit sharing creating trust among institutions and countries. Another con cornerstone of this movement is not just people but also the idea the intellectual knowledge by developing regional talent pipelines. Our universities and research centers can exchange scholars, PhDs and earlier carry researchers under unified bricks program. This accelerates skill diffusion and cultural collaboration ensuring that our breakthroughs reflect diversity of thought in all areas. However, scientific operation must be matched by educational reform. The I revolution is outpacing the capacity of traditional curriculara which we are usually using in our universities and classrooms across bricks plus institutions. We must modernize our educational programs to embed critical thinking, reasoning, cognitive skills, data ethics, foundations in natural science and artificial intelligence across disciplines. Such modernization should not stop at university gates. We need a dynamic model of lifelong learning powered by industry embedded micro credentials when corporate and academic partners co-design short stackable courses in areas such as machine learning applications in various industries. They make AI skills accessible to working professionals and expand the national innovation base by aligning curricular to industry needs. We also make reskilling continuous. A data scientist in a manufacturing plant, a doctor using predictive tools, or a lawyer navigating algorithmic complaints. All should be part of one connected learning ecosystem. The bricks platform provides a scale to make this vision real. When science, education, and industry intersect, traditional sectors transform. In healthcare, crossnational air research is already using federated data learning techniques to diagnose disease without compromising privacy. In law, AI assisted compliance systems are helping harmonize regulations across emerging markets. In manufacturing, collaborative robotics and predictive maintenance",

In finance, AIdriven credit analytics are extending financial inclusion. In agriculture, precision farming guided by satellite data and local crop intelligence is improving yield while conserving resources. All of these frameworks depend on one thing. Open cooperative science built upon mutual trust among bricks bricks plus partners. AI is not just a technology. It is an expression of how we imagine our collective future. by investing together in shared labs, unified intellectual property policies, talent exchanges, and co-created educational frameworks. Bricks Plus Nations can define a more balanced global AI order, one that prioritizes social impact alongside economic returns. Let this forum mark a renewable renewed commitment to align our scientific strengths to build bridges between classrooms and companies and to ensure that AI serves humanity's broadest goals. BRICS nations have always been engines of creativity and resilience. Together through scientific cooperation in AI, we can lead not just innovation but in shaping a more equitable digital century. Thank you so much. [applause] Thank you very much Ajit. you know the the word that we have this mutra I'm sorry for for pronouncing it wrongly mira is a kind of a Russian word there is a Russian word subotnik you know we had that in the Soviet time people gathered together to clean the parks and other things but anyway I asked gigacha to come up with another response so mutra can be translated in Russian with another word Maybe you know that would relay the essence of this word Portuguese Brazilian word is mutual help mutual assistance and mutual support and I'm really glad that all the speakers were talking about that this mut mutual support mutual understanding and mutual assistance is the main topic that we are going to use to underpin our cooperation in AI. I'm talking about the international AI alliance and all our efforts. So, I'd like to thank all the speakers and I'd like to thank all those present here and on watching us online and we are continuing with the second day of AI journey. Thank you very much. Now we are going to present the speakers with case boxes, special presents, special gifts. A round of applause to all of the participants. of the discussion. So I would like to thank all of the participants for the fantastic discussion and obviously I would like to thank the moderator.

What is the benefit of it today and how to enhance the effect in the future? We are already reaping the fruit of AI, manufacturing, transport, finance. Soon on stage, we will hear from experts from Russia, China, Bahrain, Congo, Malaysia, and the US. Stay tuned for keynote talks about AI transformation. All of the viewers can get feedback from our speakers. You can scan the QR code on the screen. You can submit your question and your name. And at the end of each session, these speakers will answer the most interesting questions. Let's continue. Science fiction gives you questions and reality gives you answers. New challenges for the future, brief history of AI, its current uses, and the use cases for dozens of years to come. Imagination does shape the world. That's what our next speaker thinks. Author, science fiction writer, co-author of the book AI 2041, Tifan Chen with a report on the future of artificial intelligence from fiction to reality. Good morning everyone. , it's my great pleasure to be here on the stage of AIG in Moscow. Today I want to share you the future of AI from imagination to reality. So, as a science fiction writer, I always been asked why we need to read science fiction to better understand the reality and the future because somebody might say, \"Oh, it's all imagination. It's all made up, right? So, it's like bushing and making no sense at all.\" But actually, it is not. Let me tell you why. we can see the chronology of AI from different aspects. For example, you can see in terms of evolution of technologies. So we can see all these curves like waves. It comes and goes in history, right? So imagine if we are living in one of this curve like we're in the 60s when AI just emerged. Can we predict? Can we imagine we're in the second wave of AI boom which means the expert systems and when we were if we were living in the time of 80s right so like Joan McCarthy so back in the 70s and 80s he said like we will be able to create machine things like human within 5 to 8 years but of course it never happen. Can we imagine from the '9s we will have deep learning",

        "text": "time of 80s right so like Joan McCarthy so back in the 70s and 80s he said like we will be able to create machine things like human within 5 to 8 years but of course it never happen. Can we imagine from the '9s we will have deep learning network just like Jeffrey Hinton did in his lab is quite marginalized in a way. So nobody ever believe in him in his direction. Right? So basically this is our limitation because human intend to think in a linear manner but actually reality happen in different way and think about all of those iconic figures, products and events right. So think about when each one of them emerge in history everyone will think oh this is really revolutionary but we all know like figures they have their lifespan they have their limitation and products they all have their life cycle. So it just comes and goes again and each one of them might represent a school, a style, a direction of imagining the future of AI. Let's think. Okay, here might be some timeline of the AI robotic imagination in the classic sci-fi movies and you know fictions when Arthur C. Clark working together with director Stanley Kubri in 1968. So they imagine in the year 2001 we can travel we can fly to the moon and we have base there and everyone can read the news u from this kind of tablet and we can have the super intelligent AI to governance the spaceship like how 9000 and we can see maybe it didn't happen in the year 2001 But it happened definitely later. So I would say I will argue that the best class of science fiction they predict something right but in different time in different shape. So we might see it as kind of metaphor. Let me give you some example. So this is the almost 100 years ago when when Chapek his Czech so he wrote this theater play IUR Rousam's universal robots and it was adapted into different theater also in Russia back in the day. So he imagined in the future robots might replace human labors and there might be a strike rise by the robots and the robot the term actually from Czech a robot which means force labor but you know three years ago when I was in Los Angeles in LA so I witnessed is this massive strike happening in Hollywood you know proposed by all this human writers. Can we imagine that? Can we imagine this kind of strike actually happen not in physical labor not in the field of manufacturing but in creative works. So this is something of course Chapek makes something right and get something wrong but we see it in a metaphorical way. So he predict the future of this conflicts within the capitalistic system and this ine distribution of resources of time and hierarchical power dynamic basically were causing a lot of problem through",

So he predict the future of this conflicts within the capitalistic system and this ine distribution of resources of time and hierarchical power dynamic basically were causing a lot of problem through acceleration of technology and automation of everything. Let me give you another example. So this is from the classic science fiction writer Isak Asimov. So we all know that right? So people in the room three laws of robotics a robot may not injure a human being. A robot must obey orders. A robot must protect its own existence. And actually it was first introduced to the world in his short story run around in 1942 and expand this idea later in his I robot the classic one. But you know can can he can Azimov imagine almost like 80 years after we might find that some mother you know accusing AI basically make his son like 14 year old boy committed suicide because of character AI and he's basically she's basically suing the AI company for allegedly contributing to his son's death, her son's death. But you know, as parents, we always blame on technologies, video games, mobile phones, internets. But maybe it's not all of the problem is maybe sometimes we should ask ourself what parents did wrong to their children's right and think about the human enlightenment issue. So this is the classic one and also my favorite one. I I rewatched this film since kid because I couldn't get it. You know when I was a kid back in the kindergarten I start to watch this film and I always fell asleep when you know the spaceship travel through the Stargate. It's kind of psychedelics in a way and it's quite you know dazzling but I just couldn't get it. But you know what? Now we're talking about the killing AI. So when how 9,000 speak the iconic lines. I'm sorry Dave I'm afraid I I can't do that. So because the AI through the lip reading reading the lip of the astron speaking to each other they plan to shut down the AI and AI decided he must take the first move he want to kill two astronauts and we're we're talking about alignment issue right now but to me in the movie actually shows the humanity enlightenment of the AI because it fears it fears the death. It fears to be shut down by human beings. And by the end of the I think when Dave is about to shutting down you know taking off one piece by the other the chips out of the machine it just slowly fading away its consciousness and it started to sing a lullaby and that was the most beautiful moment and it captured me. It was haunting me for all the time and couldn't we say this is the most human",

It was haunting me for all the time and couldn't we say this is the most human about alignment, we have to ask ourself with whom we require the AI align with which country, which civilization, which class, which race, right? So and which level of the value from the nationalistic to family level or to individualist level. So this is all very ambiguous question. They might be not easy answer out there and humanity. Are we static since the caveman time or we are just continuously evolving through the time through the history? I think that's the question. I don't have a clear answer yet but I might urge you to reflect on that. And to me, science fiction offers us a diversified, open and nonlinear lens, a cognitive hedging system to counterbalance the bias. You know because each one of us we were trapped we were trapped in our own momentum our own limitation of thinking our you know our social construction you know the way of seeing things the way of thinking about things the way of imagining the future basically was quite limited but through reading different versions of the future It might expand expand our cognitive infrastructure and what's more important to benefit from the uncertainty. Right? So right now we're embracing huge massive uncertainty in human history. But just like Nasim Talb in his famous book anti- fragile he said the the most important things how we create this kind of ability how we nurturing our ability to benefit to gain something out of all this uncertainties I think that's the most important thing we have to learn nowadays And of course I'm here because of this book. I think maybe some of you have read it and I my co-author Dr. Ky Lee was speaking previously through the screen and in this book we predict and we try to predict a lot of futures with AI with human interaction and we touch upon different sectors healthcare education finance media warfare even sustainability and across different cities around the world and one thing actually was so fascinating because we co-authored this book during the time of co from 2019 to 2021 when the book was published in English and traditional Chinese and one year later it got published in simplified Chinese and right now we have 20 something language editions and I'm so happy. It was kind of popular here in Russia and I I I met people all around and said they how much they love the book. But do you remember in 2022 November the 30th when chat GPT was launched basically it changed how we imagine the future of AI right so that was actually one year after the book was published. So many things in the book",

So many things in the book all the details of how technology might evolve especially on AI could be wrong for example one story happened in Africa lers we're talking about in the future people still using the model GAN you know generative adversarial network to predict to produce all this deep fake imageries animation themes whatsoever but actually one year after you know diffusion model emerged so it basically changed everything so this is what I found fascinating when we try to predict the technology like mostly we got it wrong because we only see things in a very linear way but when we try to capture The humanity mostly we got it right. Why? Because humanity is more stable, right? It's just like the bad rock in the ocean. And the technology just basically like the water it comes and goes. It's always like that waves after waves is always changing. So this is a very f futurology perspective how we see futures in different ways. You can see maybe literature, maybe films, all kind of creations. It try to encapture all the possible futures. While science fiction [snorts] is very good at you know projecting plausible future, probable future even some of them are good at projecting like very specific scenario of the future. But what's the best best kinds of science fiction to me is through the storytelling we are able to create the preferable future. That's the future we are aiming for. We try to create. We try to demonstrate. We try to actualize through the storytelling through building up all this consensus and share imagination about the future. I want to share you a story from ancient Chinese mythology. It's talking about a king meets the artifier Yen. So he's the master of building things. So who present a mechanical man that can sing, that can dance and even flirt with the king's lover. And the king got so angry and he wants him to execute it. But Yen Shu the monster dissembles the man called uncle man into all the uden parts. So to show the king actually there's nothing there. There's no one man hidden be behind the scene to making all the things up. So this is quite fascinating. It could be the very first science fiction in human history. You know it's talking about human no robots just like our silver bank launch [snorts] yesterday. And what we can see deeper in this story is basically you see a lot of illusion of anthomicizing itself. So we project our jealous or envy our angry or even passion or love onto another thing. the otherness, the object, the humanoid, you know, crafting. And",

So we project our jealous or envy our angry or even passion or love onto another thing. the otherness, the object, the humanoid, you know, crafting. And awe and dread, like fear and favor of technologies. And this is something we're always been trapped. We always try to escape. And also AI could be the thing to blur all these lines between what is real, what is force, what is human, what is machine, and what is emotion, what is simulation. Basically, when you're talking to the model, sometimes you might feel, oh, it it really does understand how I feel, right? It feels like it's the best friend, is the even perfect lover in a way. But is that real? And what is real? The feeling is real, right? But what about what about the projection of yourself onto it? Is that real? So think about the recursive feedback loop create by this human machine interaction. I created thing you know it's not [snorts] about what is the technology what is AI what is the machine looks like in the future but it's also about how we see the technology and how we interact with the technology in Chinese it's called guanchi relationship so I I I I draw this charts you know you can see the you know xyaxis with the in int intelligence level and the time and there's human baseline and there's machine intelligence. So I just summarize in different pattern of imagination of human machine power dynamic. So I'll explain each one of them in a very brief way. So like people told me in Russia when you when you when you mention AI when you mention robotics people were always going back to oh that's Terminator right and that's Skynet. So I think that's the mentality not only in Russia but all around the world will human beings be and nai will be erased by the machine totally from this planet will will us be enslaved by another species. But what if the real skynet is not the future AI but just our decision to build today's AI entirely on war logic and arm race incentives. We're thinking that way sometimes we're thinking everything is zero some games, right? We have to be we have to be dominant. we have to be the only winner and we have to build something to erase the rest of the others. So what if that kind of mentality be learned be picked up by AI and it help it to become something just like Skynet in the future and let's see another kind of imagination of human machine relationship is machine slavery right slavery and later on there will be revolution so this is also in a very famous TV series west But does dreaming of robots uprising",

So that's just another way of you know you know try to distract the focus and it doesn't make things any better. And another classic very negative very dark imagination of future human machine dynamic is human becomes become the battery form. So it's the resource can be exploited. So actually it's what we are facing right now right all these platforms already mining our data and attention in the most in extreme way right so basically we were trapped in this kind of attention seeking game was just spreading stretching our attention as thin as possible across different medias but how to be focusing how to how to help our generation, younger generation to rebuild their attention, their cognitive ability to think deep, to write deep. So this kind of repu or bupio fantasy expose the system or just excuse us from refusing changing the game. Of course, we have some bright one. We have symbiotic society mode which from one of my favorite animation series the pantheon which was show last year. But think about when upload consciousness and that kind of virtual world virtual mix of human robotic and AI whatsoever intelligence just another projection of the reality hierarchy into a symbiotic AI future. So are we really transforming anything at all? Are we really transforming the power dynamic or just with hot coding today's domination into tomorrow's ecology? So yeah, so this is all the questions I want to ask, I want to raise and to me like imagination forms narratives, narrative shape reality. So we are living in the world of poly crisis. We have geopolitic crisis. We have economic crisis. We have clim climate change crisis. We have all this crisis. But also the imagination crisis. We're lacking of new imagination. So can we tell new story about AI of the future? So this is the new book just got published in China. It's called ocean break. It's a ocean and climate change fiction. But in this novel, so I create this so-cal leela large intelligent lunatic agent in the future. So it's talking about like this AI or she or they call themsel call themsel EI. So it's emergence intelligence which emerged from the human trash data set of all time and it tried to unlearn all this humanistic human centric value to expand to other species even the whole planet and it tried to create this kind of planetary sensory layer not only to observe outward but also reflecting inward to see what's happening within the planet within the atmospheres and it tried to inspire the human agency",

So let's go back to the question. how can we benefit from all these uncertainties? So basically this is what we're doing right now. We recognize ourself from the mirror of otherness. We see all this fear and flavor bipolar. We see this zero sun phobia. We see this human centric blind spot because we couldn't think beyond that. And also we all trapped in this dark forest paranoia. Right? So this is what we see from all this imagination of human and AI relationship of the future. The question is can we become a better human rather than asking can we build a better AI. So that's my that's my argue right. Parents always think about, oh, how can I raise a better child, smarter child? How can I, you know, nurturing a more care caring, a more beloveing offsprings? But it's just the mirror you how to look into yourself. So this is three quotes about the future. Two of them from my favorite science fiction authors. One from William Gibson. Everyone must know this. The future is already here just not evenly distributed. It reflects the capitalistic future. The narrative. And the other one from Ursula Luin she said the future is already full. is much older and larger than our present and we are all the aliens in it. So it represent the alien native future which human are kind of irrelevant and could be something even more marginalized in the future. But to me I might argue that we need to build up this kind of participatory future with every future we wish to create. We must first learn to imagine it. To me imagination just like muscle is something you can practice you can learn is part of the future literacy. You have to learn how to sensing the future, how to knowing the future, how to extrapolate, extrapolating the future and how to integrating the future to creating the future. I think all of those should be part of our education system. Like yesterday, Mr. President mentioned how we can change the education to help the younger generation to adapt in the age of AI. I think this might be part of the answer like how to encourage the younger generation the children to imagine. So this is what AI still couldn't do right. This is what they are not ready there yet and this is the future we really need to cocreate all together. So thank you. Thank you [applause] Vasha. Thank you very much for expanding our imagination.

Thank you chain [applause] capital. The capital meets breakthrough. This is how you achieve scale. How AI and high tech transform the entire industries investment portfolios and the structure of export. someone who has built for the foreign direct investment fund a network of the investment partners that are joined by investors from more than 15 countries. The special representative of the president of the Russian Federation on the investment and economics cooperation with the foreign countries. The general director of the Russian direct investment fund, Kuril Mitrif is going to report on the investments in the future AI and high technologies. Thank you very much. I wanted to welcome you all. I can see that you we have very motivated, driven and smart people here. They use AI actively and they are driving AI. I would like to share some thoughts that we have on artificial intelligence and the thoughts on how AI should be properly used and invested in and promoted. But first of all, I would like to thank ZBA bank no sorry Zur and Herman Graph for this fantastic conference and for all their contribution to AI development. And I think we have forgotten the fact that just 10 years ago, 8 years ago maybe as Bur was criticized in terms of whether they need this ecosystem, why they're not just a bank and it was Mr. Graph who insisted that the ecosystem was important that the development of technologies was important and they were at the core of the bank development and they are now I mean Zur now is one of the leaders in AI. as Bur has gone through many barriers very was a pretty convoluted path to the end goal because many were put in barriers was there and this way of for any of us that lies ahead when that we need to go through when we need to create the value this is a major goal we say that one of the major goals is to have in five or 10 years in Russia AI with a very high IQ level and let's maybe I'll I'll expand my thought here. We know that IQ this is the the ratio of intellectual capabilities in various estimates 100 points in IQ is the average level 160 170 level of IQ means that this is a genius. what we see right now in many models we see the models with IQ of 240. So we see a number of models that have higher IQ than the people who are geniuses and we start to compare the",

So we see a number of models that have higher IQ than the people who are geniuses and we start to compare the people but with that of humanity. So maybe soon we will see the AI who will that will be more powerful than the entire humanity and we are talking with representatives of many countries including the countries of the Middle East and they say that the major goal for the country is to have the most powerful AI in the next 5 10 years to make sure that you do not lag behind other countries because just imagine the world that has where someone as an AI with IQ 10 of 10,000. Others have an AI with IQ 5,000 and you have the AI with IQ 1,000. For those who have an IQ models with with 10,000 of IQ points, that means that you have various biotechnologies and fusion technologies and other high techch and valuable and affordable technologies that they can leverage. So this is a competition. This is a race, a leap forward in terms of who is going to have this powerful AI in the next 10 years and who will not and Russia has a number of very important advantages here and you have to we have to to leverage that and yesterday the president mentioned that we have a major advantage in terms of energy. As we know, energy underpins AI and the fact that Russia has various sources of energy that can be used in various AI applications is obviously Russia's global advantage. Basically, thanks to our energy capabilities, we are a very interesting partner and promising partner for any countries and companies that develop AI because we have a very powerful energy advantage over them. The second important advantage of Russia is regulation because in Russia you can and you should really change various regulations to make sure that driverless cars and driverless flying vehicles are used e and can be used quicker. and our regulations are more liberal than those in Europe and other countries. So our data can be used better in a more efficient way and uniting this data can be done very quickly. So regulation is a major advantage and the third major advantage of Russia people. [clears throat] We have very talented highly educated and motivated successful people in our country and without a doubt this level of education helps not only to make the leap forwards in AI but helps to use AI in a proper way and in a successful way and using AI is the skill that should be adopted by everyone and we know that at the start the AI users were mostly mathematicians or engineers but now people are using AI in their everyday life. For example, one of my friends",

        "text": "proper way and in a successful way and using AI is the skill that should be adopted by everyone and we know that at the start the AI users were mostly mathematicians or engineers but now people are using AI in their everyday life. For example, one of my friends and he uploaded the chat in telegram with his girlfriend to AI and AI gave such a response that their relationship is growing and only a year after that conflict he admitted to her that that was AI responding to to her needs in the chat. Using AI in various situations is something that is critical and for that you need high level of education that we have in Russia that Russians have and yesterday President Putin raised an important issue of motivation in the world where every text any text can be created by AI and now there is research that from Many people who ask AI to write a text and in 5 minutes they do not remember what they requested and prompted the AI machine to write because there is no engagement. There is no thinking process. How do you make sure that the symbiosis with AI is successful? How do you make sure that people are motivated to develop? How do you ensure that they see AI as a tool instead of a comprehensive all-absorbing matrix which will fully control their lives? In this respect, what's truly important is our efforts together with SPAR on guidelines on how to use AI and also education which needs to give people not just skills to use AI but also some sort of a moral framework or ethical framework for using AI. And this is a great segue for me to international partnerships. We believe that it is only through international collaboration and international partnerships that we can implement the Russian potential in AI faster and in in a more robust fashion. We've been partnering up with companies in the Middle East in Asia and we see that in terms of regulation and the cooperation among our companies this international aspect is absolutely crucial. International collaboration is important for Russia to build a component base which will be integral to technological sovereignty. I'll I'll draw a few examples. One example is the company called Mtoica. about 10 years ago, we've invested in it. They produce prosthetics for children. They use AI very actively. They are present in more than 30 countries. And this is a great example of our technology which is one of the best technologies in the world for manufacturing prosthetics using AI. We also support on tech company for face recognition. They are actively present in Saudi Arabia and in other countries as well. They leave all of the data inside the country within its perimeter. They are building meaningful partnerships with the countries in the Middle East because they help them control the risks, mitigate the risks of",

They are building meaningful partnerships with the countries in the Middle East because they help them control the risks, mitigate the risks of misuse of data by other countries. So it is through partnerships with a large number of countries that we need to move towards the development of AI AGI. this is how we need to this is why we need to take advantage of the AI alliance which as you know has expanded as was announced yesterday and we need to acknowledge that without international collaboration international partnerships the development of AI will be hampered it will be less successful and in conclusion I would like to touch upon this one thing I know that there is there's a lot of students here today from various ious universities from various areas of specialization. I would like to encourage all of you to be very careful, very rational in approaching AI. You need to know what prompting is, what an AI agent is, and how you can use it to simplify a large number of everyday tasks. One of the key ways to go about it is to daily use Gigahat or other platforms to understand to learn the different ways to use AI. We often ask people to debate on a certain topic. So you can write a very simple prompt like analyze this or that industry or you can ask it to imagine what five or six industry leaders would say about this topic or you can upload a memorandum and ask to identify points of analysis or gaps or ways to improve this document. There are a lot of profound and beneficial ways to take advantage of AI for each one of you. And I encourage you to to give it a try. I only have just a couple of minutes of time. If you have any questions, three or four questions, I'll be happy to answer. Please go ahead. I think we don't have the mics for the audience, so you can just stand up and ask the question. The interpreter does not hear the question. Yes, thank you. The question was, how do I personally use AI? I use it sometimes to write a presentation. So, I'm I'm in a car driving to the conference. I I have five or 10 minutes. So, I put in this prompt. Imagine you are a speaker at this conference. What would you say about AI? in five bullet points. So that's one use. another use case is we create we develop different projects and different industries. For example, we are going to invest very heavily in satellites. So I have this project which not only give me analytical insights on satellites on the market but it also gives me this news feed every day on the latest developments and the",

So I have this project which not only give me analytical insights on satellites on the market but it also gives me this news feed every day on the latest developments and the interest. Also, it's very easy, very it's very easy to use it for translation. our press service, our marketing team use it in just a couple of minutes or in a second. You can translate the text, you can summarize it, you can turn text into a post for social media. I haven't taken any training on AI. It's just it all just comes from experience. You you try it, you try different use cases, you explore it. But it's very important as was said yesterday to be motivated because it's very easy to get lost to lose your engagement to stop thinking and it's a great danger actually. Yes, please go ahead. Another question. A round of applause for curl midrif. Oh, they're ushering me from the stage. It's just that we have questions submitted through the QR code, the platform from the online audience. So the question is in which industries of Russian economy is AI the most beneficial? Well, clearly in all industries, but I I like this example very much. There's this company called Lab Advance. It works with a lot of oil and gas companies in Russia. It is entering the markets in the Middle East. Essentially, it analyzes deposits using AI in a much more efficient way. So AI creates a model of of an oil and gas deposit and this reduces 40 to 60 times the cost of exploration and development. This is a very concrete effect and another example. This is a very important example and we see more examples anywhere in in the agricultural sector for example where drones with AI on board can be beneficial for agriculture. We are witnessing radical changes, disruption in all industries and an increase in their performance and their efficiency several fold in the next 7 to 8 years and and also if you learn to use it, if you use it routinely, this will give you a competitive edge. Thank you. We can continue with the questions from the audience. Yes, please go ahead. The speaker is asking the question without the mic. Right. So in your presentation you said several times that we are working closely with countries in the Middle East in Asia on AI. But I'm especially interested in this in the west in the US for example they've been developing AI very actively as well and Russian companies are represented there as well the energy sector journalists what is your personal opinion what are the opportunities there what are the opportunities for collaboration with western countries such as the US. Thank you very much for this question. I think this will be the last question.",

Thank you very much for this question. I think this will be the last question. we need to be open-minded and it's good that this is the final question. I think we need to be open-minded and we need to understand that a lot of Western countries are hostile to to Russia. But that said, Europe while waiting itself off of Russian gas lost trillions and trillions. We have data from German businesses which say that next year 41% of companies from Europe will be firing employees and only 13% will be hiring. So the Russian market is extremely important for for European countries. They tried to create isolation short-term isolation. It didn't work. So I think we will see more and more companies trying to get back to the Russian market in the next two to three years building new partnerships and the government will be deciding who they will be letting in. But the point is that the Russian market is very important for the western countries and we believe that as soon as we see some positive changes in our relations with the US for instance just an hour later Europe will come running back trying to get back to the Russian market. We are open to collaboration, but within the framework of this understanding that a lot of European companies ran away from the Russian market and left all kinds of assets and employees behind. So we need to maintain our sovereignty but still be open. Thank you very much. CEO of Russian direct investment fund Kir Mitrif. Thank you for that presentation. Let's be mindful of the timing and move on. Industry is akin to chess on on a real board. One model is a combination. An ecosystem is a strategy. The one who sees who sees the whole board will win. Data, people, partners. How do you play without time troubles and with a tangible effect? Let's hear from someone whose strategy is not on paper but in the real sector of economy.

Great, the sound is back on. Let's begin again. My name is Dinis Novikov, the CEO of Apatites, the main assets for the Force Agro group at Force Agro. I'm responsible for AI development and our journey into the world of AI, Gen AI, started not that long ago at the end of last year when we got off our own GPU infrastructure.

The first thing we did was we built our own corporate GBT chat for all our employees to use for their work rellated tasks without the risk of corporate works. [music] The prompt is create a presentation one slide for the presentation. So in our chat under the hood we have several LLMs including giga chat max deployed in the IT parameter web interface and inference of LLMs is done mainly on open-source solutions. So, as you see, the the initial prompt to the chat was rather simple, rather straightforward to generate a slide of a presentation and it's very close to what you're looking at. Boss Agro is indeed a Russian vertically integrated company, one of the global leaders in manufacturing potassium fertilizers phosphorus fertilizers. We are not just a fertilizer manufacturer. We also have been adopting AI very actively. The key components here are strategy, people, infrastructure, data and solutions. meaning AI based solutions and their integration into the company's IT landscape. Speaking of the strategy, a part of our enterprisewide strategy is the sub substitution of foreign sourced software with domestic software. And in that regard, we are a leader of industrial competencies in chemistry and pharmaceutics in terms of the number of successful import substitution projects. Domestic IT solutions are also the groundwork for the integration of our AI solutions developed in house. The topic of AI transformation is a big topic for our corporate strategy. And here the biggest goal, the major goal is to implement AI solutions across the board in all of our processes support processes corporate business processes all of them need to have functionality supported by AI and the top down tone tone of voice I think you all know what that means as the general director I am directly responsible for all of these issues. People the biggest asset the biggest value that we have today the the key center of competence on AI is the IT team working on AI. We have been actively developing the IT stream and today we have experts in all areas of AI which enables us to develop and deploy pretty much any practical solutions that our teams need. AI transformation isn't possible without engaging all of the employees of the company. So today we have 16 product teams which involve all of the owners and main experts from all of our business processes. We've also been actively developing our product teams and this gives good results over the past two months. These teams have generated more than 850 ideas for AI solutions for their processes. Some of them are in the works and others are pending the effect assessment and further prioritization. Our talent cultivation program is based on collaboration with different universities. And so we also decided to engage school children and partners from educational institutions to make sure that people",

And also we want AI to become a basic a routine technology for all of our employees. Next section, infrastructure. We have two data centers. All software, all information is stored on our own infrastructure. We've also started to build the third data center because we need additional capacities. And based on that foundation, we will be building a decentralized model of GPU servers to manage them and distribute the resources in a more efficient way. from data to solutions. even though we are an manufacturing company, we have this classic pyramid of automation of a manufacturing company. At the base of the pyramid is the automation of the technological processes, industrial processes, then all the way to the top level to data and data management. We collect data from all of these layers of the pyramid and use them to create our solutions. We use the first two components to develop various personal assistance and advisor and the corporate systems used mostly for the various optimization and streamlining solutions for the corporate processes. The slide shows the u major the high level workflow. I'm going to talk about our solutions. We'll start with the most simple things very simple but very useful solution. Our employees, our users are using Astro Linux. That's a Russian operating system. They use seven R seven office editing package and to streamline their process on moving to the Russian software we added the rag explanation to for the migration to this new product. So the employees can now easily find the information on new products. the service has proved to be very efficient and useful. It's like if you substitute imported solutions and you have your own GPT chat u add you can add that information to the bot so that employees can easily and quickly find the information. The assistant for the maintenance and repair can be used for statical and dynamic equipment. If you have proper data to train mathematical models, you can make this assistance here. as an example, this is the an assistant for 16 large mills ball mills in our factories. more than 400 mathematical models. Calculate 16 mills with 680 tags and the accuracy of defects detection is 94%. It's fully open source solution and delivered by Fossar IT team. We have seen the 64% decrease of the down unplanned downtime of the mills and these assistants can also help you to make repairs when needed also that will help you to improve the work time.

I think that in the future we're going to tell you what was the actual result. The next case the next solution is using AI together with the classical [snorts] process robotization. I think you know what is a process robotization. The majority of you knows about that. So I'm not going to talk about that in detail. These are the robots that do routine tasks, repetitive tasks that are repeated in the same fashion. We use the same robots. We use more than 200 robots, different robots. And now we're working on Pix Robotics. That's a Russian solution. There are two major limitations and meaning the conditions when the rovers can be working. this is the cyclical operations and the very structured information in in the input for the input. Together with the developers we have added to the capability of adding LLMs under the hood and now the structuring of in the information can be done by the LLM and further down the road our plan is to make sure that these scenarios that can be processed by a robot can have some variability and for these purposes we are going to use LLMs as well. The next case AI chemic chemist or AI chemist. This is one of the first in Russia solution where Jin AI is working within one interface for the mineral fertilizer factories as well as other large industrial companies. The automated system for production management is required. This is a complex production system management system. This system processes more than 100,000 various parameters like temperature, concentration of various acids, the pressure of the steam in the various equipment units as well as pipelines. [gasps] A lot of information and all of that is visualized on the diagrams on the schemes. This at the start of this year we substituted the imported solution in our factory in Cherup Povves. It helped us to also to implement AI elements there as LLM. We use Giga Chat Max that has been deployed on prem [snorts] and I'll show you a small video to show how it actually works. Giga chat requests through MCP protocol the forecasted and the actual parameters. Here we're talking about the concentration of the nitric acid. the data is compared by the chat with the regulation technology regulation that has been added to the LLM with the rag and if there are deviations it gives recommendations to the operators and the main dispatch team currently humans are making the final decision because we're talking about dangerous production",

Gigachhat will also can also create and generate various reports and statements that helps to very quickly prepare and draft such documents by the operating team. These solutions are going to be developed and implemented for all of our factories and equipments because using AI in production systems can improve the output capacity up to 10% increase in the output. That's our expectation. That means hundreds of thousands of tons of mineral fertilizers potentially. But that's not it. we are moving forward our next case the system that I wanted to talk about now I'm I'm sure that when we fully develop it and put it in in in production we think that this is going to be a totally unique first of a kind solution it is going to be AI in ERP system today we substituting the imported ERP system. we are substituting it with the Russian ERP system. we change some models the production we're optimizing the cost and now we understand that the possible integration in the Russian systems of these solutions of analytical and generative AI should be done and we decided to add Gen AI by design in the as we developed started to design and develop the ERP system this generative AI in the ERP system will help to optimize various tasks in major processes like procurement, maintenance, project management and other modules that are going to be integrated in the ERP system. JI will also be able to generate within the ERP system any management reports. I will put the prompt and receive the answer. Generative AI can also be an assistant in the RB system. It will help users to [snorts] better manage the system. So the geni capabilities in this complicated heavyweight information systems I mean can provide great cap capabilities and you have to take advantage of that. That's it for us. , please visit our booth here at the conference. We will walk you through many other cases that are very promising. A round of applause. CEO of Apatit Denis Novikov.

Andre Biff, a very warm welcome to the vice president of Zbeer, senior vice president of Zbear. Hi guys. Terrific to see all of you today. Great of you to come. A lot of people watching us online because this room couldn't fit everyone. We're going to talk about the tech announcements that our teams have been prepping over the past couple of",

        "text": "vice president of Zbear. Hi guys. Terrific to see all of you today. Great of you to come. A lot of people watching us online because this room couldn't fit everyone. We're going to talk about the tech announcements that our teams have been prepping over the past couple of because the things that we're going to introduce we had never done before and some things no one had ever done before. So, let's roll. Now, Giga Chat this year, at the start of this year, we had only 2 million users. One year down the line, the audience grew tfold. Crucial this thing is because at this point, you're always excited. You're excited about the things that are going to happen, how we are sustaining the load, what the people are going to ask, what's going on. It's always a point where you can think where you think of what you can do better. And people ask all kinds of things of us. They [snorts] talk with our devices. They write queries to the chat room. They talk in the messengers in the Telegram bots. All kinds of topics. But in all honesty, I think I don't want to write at some point. I want to talk to our assistants. Andre, did you mean talking with me? Do you remember to tell our viewership how cool I am? I will try to do that because recently we have been thinking long and hard about how we make our communication convenient and the new voice mode that we gave to our giga chat. It enables easy conversation without diverting your attention. Now before coming off coming on this stage I trained with the assistant because this is the most convenient way to interact. You no longer want to read. You no longer want to write. You want to you want a conversation. I just don't want those robotized voices. I don't want to listen I don't want to listen to the end of the response at at the column at the speaker. Sometimes I want to interact by interjecting like she did just now and that's what I can do now. We launched this function a couple of days ago and people have spoken about 2 years worth of conversation. They spoke 2 years of tear time with the assistant. They like it. We thought about what is likable too. What's likable by the people? You know, I've got this story. It's not all of my time that I spent in the office. I like to take a walk. I like spending time with my family like all of you do. But sometimes I've got so much information that I have to choose. Do I run or read a new article that I have to read as often as not I use podcasts. Who has used a podcast at least once over the past month? Yes. Great. Now what I don't like about the podcast is this. Sometimes",

Now what I don't like about the podcast is this. Sometimes understand three of thoughts. I don't have that much time. I try to accelerate. I try to accelerate to 1.25 to 1.5 but that doesn't help me with the 2 hours of listening time. And then again someone is decided that he or she shares have to share something with me. I don't have to listen to that. We can do a podcast of everything. We can use any link to any document. This is turning anything into a podcast. Or you can ask Giga Chat to prepare a podcast for you. Do a research. Do a podcast of the research and that is actually a post podcast of what you want to listen to and not someone decided to tell you. My name is Maria and today we're going to discuss the importance of balance in our life. Thank you, Maria. Terribly pleasant to be part of this conversation. Essentially, you will never tell one thing from another. You can choose a voice. You can choose a timber. But listening today and get the information succinctly presented by professional hosts that is now available and you can collect it. You can use a mobile app. You can use that in our sound professional streaming service or you can just do that on route to work. any information is a personal p podcast for you with your professional hosts that are personal for you. And then again, this is not no longer enough. We worked a lot with our guys to add more ways of convenient information sharing. We we did cool presentations, cool charts. Now giga chat can do mind maps for you and just choose the right way of presenting a topic for you. You can ask a gig chat to analyze a topic and then you can listen to it, you can watch it or you can analyze it in a in a mind map because working with that information is something where a personal assistant can change your life in. He can make you more informed, more more versed, better versed in a topic. But none of this works unless you develop the models continuously. So over the past couple of months, our team worked on developing the third family of Giga Champ. We did that and today we are presenting two essentially new models. No one had ever done these models in Russia. Two most interesting releases. First, Gigachet Ultra. The important thing to know about it is this. Ultra is the largest the most smart model that we had had ever trained. Not just us. Even the companies that are capable of teaching a training a model of this size with this",

Not just us. Even the companies that are capable of teaching a training a model of this size with this companies in the world actually very difficult computation wise, engineering wise. But then you are recouping all this because this model is several times quicker than the models that we had before and it is smarter several times. This is top one in the Russian market. The best model for the Russian language by far any Chinese open source. And this is a preview. We are sharing it with you. We had not finished it yet. It will be even better still and it will be interesting already. Tomorrow is going to be a whole day of technical announcements and the guys are going to be telling you in detail what its inner workings are, how we trained it, what new practices were, what we learned ourselves along this way. Ultra is a cool thing because it is the biggest, the most powerful, but it requires a lot of computing power. So what we did was another model, lightning. Why lightning? Because this model it is very very quick. That's 10 billion parameters in my architecture architecture. And you can launch this model on your laptop. This is something you can take with you. This is what you can use offline. very quick model yet very smart. It fits a lot of objectives. It fits a lot of jobs and ultra both ultra and lightning we are making available on an open source basis. You will be able to use it in your projects, tune it to your projects and develop your projects based on Giga 3.0 family. We think that this is the biggest open-sourced project in Europe at this time. No one had ever done this computing of this model size on an open sourced basis. It will be important for us to see new corporate versions in the future that will be quicker still and fit on premise installations in more compact equipment. Yet I think that the country should have its own models. We must develop based on our own models. We must build new projects, new products. We must invest into our own community because this is a technology of the 21st century. The president said that much yesterday. This is the foundation of our tech development as a nation. It's crucial for us that we invest in this not just for ourselves, but it is for the sake of every one of you that we are doing this. Text is cool. What is cooler still for me? Very inspiring.

Look at Kandinski 5.0. Let me draw your attention to the detail. Look at this ultra realism. You see new level of understanding the reality by model. And look at the video that model generated. It understands Russian language. It learned to generate Russian letters. We don't we don't do large texts yet very well, but we can do a lot of things. And the physics of the world. Look at how physical the models have become. Look at how quickly they are developing. A year ago from this very stage I spoke about Kandinski 5 4.0. We can do that much linkage that much consistency but you can already use this you can already use Kandinski models either to generate images or for video. I think everyone needs that. We did two models. One light, one pro. They are obviously different in size and computational complexity. But again, very importantly for me, they are also available on open source basis. Use them as you see fit. And unless you are a data scientist, if you just want to try, you can you can do this in gighat app, telegram board, in mox messenger, in web. Just try it and I think very quickly you will get used to creating a video on demand as a normal practice for your working presentations or just to give greetings on a birthday to someone dear to you. That is all available. Images again very cool. Look at 3D. Look at what Kandinsky can do in 3D. Another type of model. What you can do is create this and then print this on any homebased 3D printer and you can play with kids or you can do those for professional things. You can do something that you have been missing some kind of a part. Again everything is open sourced telegram channel announcements. Do sign up for our telegram channel. We will consistently advise all the new releases. all everything that the guy is going to be presenting all this will be collated on that telegram channel as your assistant as an app as a bot as a web thing. It was a very important story for us to make it available pretty much everywhere in as many places we can. It's not just a new surfaces that we are doing. We're actively involving it in in the largest bear ecosystem. You can find it in Zarb bank online kids health and pretty much everyone everyone using the ecosystem app will be using an assistant.

We want you to give this new beautiful naturally synthetic voice we are taking it to all the speakers of Zbeir starting in January. A new type of voice synthesis is going to be available. I find it much more pleasant, much more comfortable to listen to. But besides the speakers, another very important device at home is TV set. Today we launch TV set that you can use by voice. I think everyone speaks. You no longer need remote control. Everything that Giga Chat can do, it's understanding of the world. It's understanding of you. It's actionable things. You can just talk about all of those things with a TV set. No more need for remote controls. And we also develop our wearables. This smart ring that we launched in September, it continues to develop. it gets more new tech features. developing the integration with the Dovia with this better health is crucial for us because the ring collects your personal parameters your personal data that you can subsequently use with with your medical with your medical officers with your doctors. You can give those parameters to someone for recommendations or you can just speak with your gigachet assistant that can interpret this data. those recommendations can be about you know better lifestyle. All of that is available everywhere. Unfortunately we live in a world where we are regularly you know excluded from app stores but this is a day where you can find Gigette in Google Play or in App Store. not the same name everywhere, but these are official QR codes and you can download those from those app stores. Do download while they are still there. It's important for us to give you the apps and in the Russian Max Messenger or in Telegram, you will always find not just not just a chatbot, but also the mini app where you can do everything or at giga. convenient format where you can use from big screens. a lot of people prefer this format of interaction. It's important for us to make Giga Chat a smart model. I told you that we want you to chat more with it, to speak more with it. It is important for the model to remember things that you tell it. So you don't have to repeat the ultra the new model that our audience is going to get it is native memory enabled. So you will either be able to remind it that's a total new level of customization total new level of customization over your interactions. Also as importantly giga chat is learning to act.

You know I found it inconvenient. I I could ask gigachet to recommend a book and I could get the recommendation but I had to leave the premise and go somewhere to buy it. This is what we this is what you can do. Right away we are launching a marketplace of agents where that you can familiarize yourself with. It will be replenished by a lot of agents. They will be creating by they will be created by us by our partners. We want to make it open to all kinds of companies that want to work with our new and increasing audience you know propose new cases propose new agents. Do get in touch with us. We're going to connect the agents for the ecosystem of Zar and you our dear partners can communicate with your clients via the new cutting edge most developed mode of interaction and the most convenient way of interacting for me. In addition to entertainment, Gigachhat provides you new opportunities in learning. It can now analyze spreadsheets and tables. You can take an Excel spreadsheet from a cloud storage. You can ask Gigahat to analyze it. right from the file. It is a difficult task for language models because it's difficult for them to understand what's in the spreadsheet in the table. It's still a challenge to process all kinds of Excel formats because there are certain things which live only in Excel. But for a regular user, we can help them analyze an Excel file. For example, we've got this numerous requests from entrepreneurs. they got analytics from their employers and they do not know what to do with it, how to work with it going forward. After you get these this file analysis and recommendations you can have it visualized. I talked about the podcast and now have a look at the presentations and dashboards that you can build based on a an Excel file. You upload your file and then you can work with the graphic visualization of information to make sure this visualization works best for you to answer all kinds of questions about the data in the spreadsheet. We've got multiple requests and we followed up and we made it happen. Can you take Gighat with you to work starting this week at Spur for all of our employees? you can use this special work mode using gighat from the company network after all the necessary checks and validations in terms of security we allowed our employees to use the cloud-based version of gighat and to upload corporate information there because all I'm talking about the",

You get your own context and your corporate context and it's all completely secure and also we are working on an installation that companies can install [clears throat] within their own perimeter or they can use a hybrid. business requests are far from exhausted because generative AI is a huge text stack with gighat application with large language models and a hybrid infrastructure that can live in the perimeter of your network or it can live in the cloud. We believe that the cloud is the technology which coupled with AI will win eventually because large computing powers is much more rationally used when you use them in the cloud. But sometimes companies may not afford it because you have certain limitations in working with data. And we will find a solution for you, a solution that is comfortable and that works on prem. A very important thing for us is the audience of developers. We've been developing this gitverse code repository, the biggest in Russia u by all comparable parameters. And we believe that the future of a developer is built on partnership with AI. Developers want to take a portion of their work the part of the work that that is no longer interesting and delegated to AI agents. Introducing Giga Code 3.0 with an agent mode. Now a developer can take part of their tasks and delegate them to the agent and then just check the result. This makes your work much more efficient. Speaking of our own developers at Giga IDE, the in-house environment, 95% of our of our developers are already using it. Why 95 instead of 100? It's just because that it's not supporting all of the technologies, but almost all of them. none of the 95% can imagine their work routine any longer without this tool. Nobody wants to be inefficient, right? But not everyone is a developer. But sometimes you do need to develop something. That's why we've created Giga Studio. This is a tool where you can build this very simple website without any coding skills, without any development skills. You only need a set of prompts and there you have it. No developer was involved in this. Anyone can use it. Anyone can become a developer even if you cannot read code at all.

I've been speaking at length about an assistant in the digital world. I've been talking about what it can do, what kind of data it can process, what kind of files it can process. But I've long been needing this assistant who can do something in the real world in in the physical world. And we have built one. Let's have a look. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] [cheering] [applause] Hello Andre. I'm happy to meet you here on the stage of AI journey. Hello dear guests, dear viewers of the conference. My name is Grin. I'm the first anthropomorphic robot by a sparr. I'm happy to meet you all. You know, Andre, the real world is really interesting. Let's let people know how's bear team worked on my own creation. Let's do just that. Please welcome Grin. Grin is the embodiment of physical AI. This is not just a robot. This is a robot that is controlled by the Gen AI based technologies that we have been working on as a huge spur team over the past years. We had confidence that AI could be embodied physically and that gave us grin. This is a very sophisticated complex technology. It has more than 100 degrees of freedom. 10 sensors and cameras that it uses to navigate in the physical world and to interact with people. We have developed we have been working on its complicated and sophisticated motoric because we do need know that it will learn to work with all kinds of objects. can be it can be a knife, it can be something fragile and it needs to be able to handle all of those things. And our goal is to make sure that grid has AI or Giga Chat on its board to build trajectories to navigate the world to communicate with people but I ask for an assistance so I will ask Grin to pick up from this. Yes, thank you. I am able to navigate room spaces and rooms that I know. I can work with different objects. I can unpack your groceries. I can make you a fresh drink. Of course, I do make mistakes sometimes as any human being, but this is an my advantage because I can correct my mistakes as opposed to your favorite car or robot vacuum cleaner.",

Great job Grin and it's true that it's only now learning and we want to do this not just with anthropomorphic robots. We want this technology to help people across the board in manufacturing in shops for all kinds of tasks. We can create robotic assistants that will make our world our lives more interesting. Grit has been preparing for a long time and this is its debut in front of such a large audience. Yesterday it danced for the first time before the president and it has something else interesting in store for you. Let's have a look. [bell] Heat. [bell] [music] [music] Heat.

That was so beautiful, so moving, so emotional, and yet technically just perfect. Let's capture this moment because the future is now. It's true. I I never thought I would ask a robot about this, but can I can I take a selfie with you? Let's invite everyone on stage. Guys, come up on the stage. All the people that have been working on Grin, please give them a round of applause. Can I take a selfie with you, please? Sure. I love selfies. Great. Not everyone is able not to bling for such a long time. Let's take another one. [applause] Awesome. Thank you so much. Thanks to everyone from the team and thank you Mr. Beller for the presentation. Today technology is becoming art. I'd like to thank spare team for the possibility to learn more about this fascinating world. See you soon. Thunderous round of applause, please. We're saying goodbye to the wonderful team and thanking them again. That was incredible. I'll be taking a peek on my tablet for for for the text and we continue from a branch to a mobile app from the risk model to the customer dialogue. AI is changing the entire money route.

President of the AI society and executive adviser of AI of his highness shake Naser AI research and development center Jasim with a report on AI in banking and finance. year here. Last year I came and I was talking about AI in the industry and today we will be talking about AI in the business and specifically in the financial sector and the banking how this is evolving in the world the biggest industry is using AI. So let's forget everything else that was done in the past and look how this is moving forward. The pillars of AI as you know it's not the infrastructure is the algorithms is the data and is our infrastructure. That's why we have $5 [snorts] trillion company like Nvidia making chips to train the data and then between the five top technology companies there is a $15 trillion worth of assets. This is all to train our large language models and and nobody's coming near them. I mean you look at Nvidia they are using u 90% of the market the the the the return on investment is growing but at the same times there are other techniques that we are using less and less the GPU so so let's look at the key types of data and the banking first of all if we look at the the banking data because we rely a lot on the on the banking on the historic ical data and the competitions. So part of it is the fundamental company data is your earnings is your income that's done for the inside work but when you go outside you need the environmental you need the alternative data and you need sentiment data customers behavior. You can't get those things for nothing. There are competitors are there. Your public data are very limited. So you need a lot of data related to the customers to the consu consumers nationally internationally. This is the biggest challenge that the banks are facing today and in the future. So that's why we see a lot of gateway companies like Google Pay, Apple Pay and others maybe you have others in Russia. They're monetizing the data. The money that they generate from selling the customers data of course the mask data is more than the earnings that they do sometimes. So more the banks are relying on their business and the more they focus on the data and how to acquire the data. So some of it they have some of it there are bilateral agreements. So on the other side what are the algorithms that we use to enhance those datas that we have from the predictive analysis to the risk fraud detection to optimizations you know the predictive is taking over a lot of banking [snorts] facilities and I'll show in a minute how the banks are",

We'll be talking about it. It takes every bank six to eight an average bank six to eight employees to do a fraud management. And it takes them over maybe three to four months to find out the final product. Once you do that, it's too late to get your money back. But with AI we have discovered that we can achieve the same things within 3 to four hours. Now we'll go to that one. So what what is the evolution of technology in in banking sector? So it started with robotic processing automations which is facilitating the back office activities you know this repeated repeated task. It it is more to do with administration. And then we have the maturity of the RPA where it goes and looks for the invoices for the contracts and does the comparison. And then we have the generative AI when the chat GPT came out in November 22. But still that is prompted by human. We have a lot of human interactions with that. So where are we going? This is the end AI agents and agentic AI where we're getting to a stage where we don't need people in the banking. This is the autonomous part and I'll be explaining that in a minute. So we start with RPA. This is how the high level automation the manual work is done. Lot of people in the banking and the business are doing repetitive jobs and we want to get rid of those jobs. So 60% of them may be achieved by RPA. RPA is not very intelligent. is a repetitive task. It does what we tell them but lot of tasks need to be done that way. You know it it it uses OCR natural language processing. It uses lot of audit ready. You have to be ready for the auditors today and I'll explain to it. You know how many% the auditors take from the banking sectors a sample only 5%. 5% of the document has been audited. 95% is not because they don't have enough time. They don't have enough resources to audit everything. So they just do the sampling. So we get lot of frauds hidden within that vicinity of 95%. So if you take 95% of few billion then you'll find out there are a lot of risks [snorts] hidden there. So we try to through AI increase the percentage of the audit or",

So we try to through AI increase the percentage of the audit or something I personally have been able to do in in the audit firm. So what what is next? Next is came up with Gen AI as I said earlier you know started with the CHBT3 to four to to five the competitors and this really helped a lot of personalization in the in the banking lot of content creation but still the data that's been trained is on the public so you have lot of accuracy on that and the prompting is done by the human still you know you go and prompt on a generative AI on Chad GPT on Gemini on KK from Alibaba on on other ones on deepseek. [snorts] So the the art of prompting varies from the expertise to non-expertise and how you get the information and how much you can rely on the information. It may be as good as what it is but this is changing now to something more of AI agents. Now what is AI agents? I mean you hear a lot of them. The AI agents is instead of you prompt we create an agent within the organization multiple agents. Each agent has steps to pro to to to follow. It has tools. It has lot of autonomy to focus on. So what are the ones that we can use in the banking? For instance, you have an agent just for your customers to look at what are the requirements and the agent has the authority to go and collect any data whether it's a PDF data or readym made data from the customers to be able to keep them. Then you have another agent looking at the security is looking at what is it called the maybe the risks the fraud because the risk is a big part of what the customer wants to invest in. The customers don't want anymore to be just telling them this is your balance and what you can do and how you can extract. They want to know what air are the historical data that you have collected, what is your trends, where you've been spending it, how you should spend it in future and they don't need to go other places. That's why in the banks now you cannot own the the customer's data anymore. You need an API. So if I have an account in three banking sectors, I need all my accounts or three agents for each account to be talking to each other. I don't want the analysis from one place and another. So that's why we have an agent for everybody. But beyond all that is the mastermind and the autonomous work where",

So that's why we have an agent for everybody. But beyond all that is the mastermind and the autonomous work where agentic AI looks at everything above the agent. So it looks at all the agents and it decides autonomously before just without referring to the banker and takes decisions. This is the mastermind. So each agents it has its own environment. It has its own decisions where it refers to the agentic AI and that one has its own path. What we have recently done also to what is called agentic rag. Agentic rag is also another step where continuously looks for the variations, changes, the updates in the market and it sends them to the agents. So imagine when you have an investment firm or you have an investment with the continuous updates from each agent and from the rag you'll be able to keep up with the timings of the markets closing in Tokyo and starting in in US and be able to manage your investment. So this investment where the bankers have an experience of many years and they cannot pass it with the maturity the agentic AI can be your man. But the condition here is that you have to get rid of the people and this is the fact because the more people you have replicating what the agentic AI is doing it will be like toppling in front of your feet. So that duplication it becomes very dangerous. So that's why people have decisions. So how the banks in future will look like like this? This is the banks of the future. You can't just put an AI in one part of it and then decide that the rest I'll be doing later. No, you can't do that because once you created the designs on the AI on the APIs then you try to create in few months time other facilities for instance you haven't done credit decision making or credit worth worthiness creditworthiness is about the lenders how much they do and there's a lot of questions on the you know ethical parts of it who are you targeting people are you biased are you not but but you need to be doing this and then try to plug in which part AI will be penetrating. So this is the banks of the future and it starts from the operational models where you have the platform you have the the talent strategy to the core technology and data. This is your core systems because the banking systems are are much different than others. They don't rely on ERPs on on normal generated systems.

So, so then you get to the to the the most important part to the the decision making. How you make the decisions, how you do credit decisions, how do you do fraud detections on the high level because the fraud becomes our biggest enemy in term of AI. So there is less reliance on that. So that those banks are now called new banks. NEO not ne. So these are the banks where we don't need people. There are no boundaries. It's not digitalization. It's not an app that you have on your mobile that you start using it to transfer money because that's that's really brainless. There is no intelligent in that anymore. You continuously do actually do more this mistakes with mobile apps than what you were doing earlier with the manual work because ma mobile app is is so probably available that you try to make rash decisions without referring to the analysis in the back end. So there are more problems but with the AI and agentic AI which is the future I think from 2025 this is what we said we said we don't need to rely on those anymore we need to take decisions ourselves and these are the part of the conversational intelligence that new banks will do most of the countries from 8 to 10% of the banks are created and move to new banks but I think in the next five to six weeks that will be more than 50% % of the banking or the investment firms because don't forget the investment firms the insurance are also in the some part so so what are the elements of those one is the customer service virtual assistance now I haven't personally seen a lot of customer virtual assistants in the banking that really triggered my eyes you know you don't want for instance another conversational or virtual assistants to greet you and ask you what is your problem and it says well I logged it and somebody will be calling you. That's not how it should work. The virtual assistant it should be able to take you through the whole journey through different scrutinization and solve your problem. It should be able to make decisions. It should be able to credit you at the same time. It should be able to advise you to to close your accounts. This is where we want the customer services.

And don't forget this becomes you the future of the banking if you continue with what the current customer service virtual assistance it will be very limited and still you need human to interact with that the credit scoring or the credit worthiness in the banking sector there are two different parts how they provide you with credit cards or in the creditworthiness loans for the lend lenders today is done through a lengthy process through your background check. A lot of banks they get it wrong as well and they don't get their money back and they get to the courts and maybe the periods are gone. Don't forget there are two types of loans. There is one is a short-term and a long-term. The short-term ones you need to make faster decision. The long-term ones that are related to investment and land and buying cars, it requires your behavior. you know it requires your spending habits your environmental your history and that's not easy to get but with AI with agents if you create an agent for each person you will be able to look at the models to generate proactive offers to people or to limited people you can't just go and say I have an offer in the bank for you know 3% interest for everybody because then you spend 70% of the I'm trying to say no to the people who are not eligible. But if you have the intelligent behind your customers or p or proposed customer, it doesn't have to be your customers on how you retain your customers and acquire other customers with the AI intelligence that goes into the credit scoring. anas say there to maintain the approval rates while cutting the default by 75% on the credit scoring. Now fraud detection as I said a lot of our times or the banking times are spent on the frauds and the frauds can be related to the data that is received or it could be to the security. Now historically it shows the banks have not been able to protect the bankers from the fraud management and and part of it that they don't tell you is when you don't get your interest rate goes down because they [snorts] have not been able to detect the frauds and the bank has been suffering from some of the biggest frauders around. At the end of the day who pays the who pays the price is the people who have their money in the bank.

So the fraud management is not for the banks is for the people and it should be also intelligent enough in future to be able to give a fraud about it if there is a time and an investment in banking. This is a very very very important AI generated fraud man investment. No one's today wants to invest based on their own knowledge or the friends or the advisers or what's in the internet. You need a customized investment framework. You need an agent that understands your investment, your habits and the risk that you want to take to be able to do investment. So there is no oneshot investment for everybody. It doesn't work like that. same thing in the cyber security. Cyber security is by far now out of the hacker's hands. There are cyber criminals that have been out of job because AI is creating the cyber attacks. So who's going to defend your network, your interest? Is it human anymore? No. Forget it. They are too slow, too far to be able to do. So we need an AI on the defense to be able to detect the attacks etc. and AI and regulations and compliance. I think the the central banks are too slow to legal to write lot of these regulations and policies to protect or also to be able to provide banks with AI regulations. The fintech is not getting anywhere and blockchain was the same thing. So you need an AI to be able to stay competitors. The customers need each your own generative AI. You don't need a general public data trained for your bait. You need the data related to you that is trained is very customized to you. Your own chat GPT that when it goes to it, it has all your information from the childhood until now your family. So so when you converse with it, it comes back to you. And of course the challenge is it becomes very complex the legacy infrastructure slowess you need to move on the investment and the strategy it cannot be done just pockets but the banks need to be part of it if they don't lead it today tomorrow they'll forget it and part of it is the ethics and the ethical values and I know everybody talking about it it's too slow to keep up with AI maybe AI can generate his own so thank you for listening to me and If there are any questions, I'll be happy to answer.

What makes the staff, partnerships? Let's meet our next speaker, the president of the African Research AI Institute, Eric Arl Nubat, with a talk on the AI ecosystem in emerging markets. Hello everyone, my name is Eric Amen Duma. like they just say I'm the telecommunication advisor of minister of ICT of the Republic of Congo. I'm also the national coordinator of African research center for artificial intelligence. Today I will be talking with you about the AI ecosystem in emerging market. But before I get start ladies and gentlemen let me say this on behalf of the government of Republic of Congo. I would like to sincerely thank you the organizer for inviting us for this important meeting. We are honored to be here and grateful for the opportunity to join this high level on future global technological cooperation. The Republic of Congo and the Russia Federation share a long very long-term and long-standing partnership based on mutual respect and strategic collaboration. Over the year, the relationship expand from traditional sectors such as defense, education, energy to include major development in science and emerging technologies. Russia expertise in high performance computing, research, autonomy system and sovereignty AI market. It's a key partner for our country. Today we are entering in a new phase of our cooperation focus on shared ambition, knowledge exchange and join innovation to build strong, secure and feature ready digital ecosystem. This come at the time where artificial intelligence has become the major global force shaping economy, industry, governance and international relation. The Republic of Congo is moving in this direction through a clear vision, ambition, and strong partnership, especially with the Russian Federation, positioning our country as the emerging hub of AI, cyber security, research, and digital governance. Now let me say this, the artificial intelligence is no longer the technical milestone. It is a becoming one of a powerful economic focus in our area. By 2030, it expect to generate $15.7 trillion in global economic value. A figure that dramatically reshape geopolitical balance and development trajecto trajectory around the world. Unlike the mature economy, emerging nation like us are not burdened by outtoate infrastructure. This is give us the strategic advantage enabling them to develop the cutting edge digital system modern agile and toted to their need without the contract of older technology. The transformation is been accelerate by powerful force. Like you say in Africa we have a very rapid urban grow.

[clears throat] This shift is enabling government to build systems that are transparent, more efficient and more responsive to the emerging markets are not simply in the global transformation. They are helping to drive it. Now let's see what define the AI ecosystem. First of all, we have the we have a digital infrastructure. This is a high availability data center. The national fiber network, the sovereignty cloud arch architecture, scalable computer and address cyber security form the operational backbone without any stack. No ACI no AI system can be achieved reliability performance and security. Second one it a data sovereignty data constitute from our perspective a prim a primary substrate of AI model control over data generation storage governance and protection is essential to ensure contextual relevance algorithm quality and national data autonomies. And then we have a talent and research capacity engineer data science university and research lab proving resource into the real technological capacity. And then the fourth one is the innovation ecosystem. Startup, incubator and tech hub convert research and idea into the deployable solution. And the last one is the governance policy and ethic regulatory framework standard and ethical guideline ensure secure interporab interoperab and accountable AI deployment. Only when this five pillar operate in integrate and synchronized matter can a nation build a resilient sovereignty and suitable AI ecosystem. Why? Let's see now why emerging market emerging market is now occupy a decisive position in the globe digital economy due due to structural advantage that the technical comprehensive. Moreever, emerging economy have the ability to deploy high efficiency, scalable digital infrastructure levering minimal legacy content and to innovate rapidly. The solution frequently outperformance those developed in such market due to their agility, resilience and suitability in the real world solution. As a global innovation become increasingly decentralized emerging market are transforming from technology consumer to primary innovation node. Let's see pillar of a successful ecosystem. I think I just already talk about this. So we need we need international cooperation, digital infrastructure, we need the human capital development, the scientific research, the local innovation, ethical standard. Now let's see the the use case. Artificial intelligence is no longer a simple technological innovation. It is restructuring core societal system across all sector in agriculture. AI optimized yield, predictive climate analytic and onions, early detection of crop treat. In finance, transaction security, expand financial inclusion, improve fraud detection framework. In healthcare, AI accelerate diagnostic, support preventive medicine. In education, it enable adaptive learning on connectivity and reduce structural inequality. In public administration, for example, AI improve transparency, process efficiency and service delivery for merging market. This application are not optional.

Now let's talk about the Republic of Congo. Building digital sovereignty in emerging nation reco deployment of core infrastructure and institutional capability. The process begin with fundamental digital assess. I save a data center to ensure secure in country data storage and processing a national fiber optic. I just talk about it. A top of this foundation the country has the country can scale an EI capability through a dedicated institution such as Karia. Keria is a African research center for artificial intelligence serving as a national herb for AI research talent development and innovation. From this emerge from this necklace emerge apply initiative including AI educational like the Wi-Fi hotspot and e government digital e government digitalization project both designed to expand services accessibility and operational efficiency. Sovereign sovereignty sovereign AI development also requires strategic partnership combining ethical cooperation with country like Russia, China, regional integration with smart Africa and academic collaboration with international university to accelerate knowledge transfer and capacity building. The key lesson is clear. Emerging market can efficiently build robust sovereign AI ecosystem when driving by the current vision structure strategy and trust global partnership. This pathway is already being operationalized by nation committed to technological ambition and digital independence. Let's see the challenge in the emerging market. Emerging market are structural content that higher digital transformation including limited infrastructure, high operational cost and sufficient high performance computing capacity, persistent cyber security exposure and significant talent automation. The challenge I are substantial yet they often act driver of innovation rather than barrier to compensate for infrastructure gaps. Country increasedly adopt age computing archite architecture decentralizing processing power and reducing reliance on large centralized data system. Where financial resource are constraint they develop high efficiency innovation model production cost effective and high scalable technological solution. Now this is the strategic pathway. First of all, it's the AI it's a talent development AI capability deepened primarily on human capital engineer data science and research to able to design secure involve advanced system national that do not train their youth advanced fuel talent pipeline and other. And then we also have a digital infrastructure. This here is a data center, the cloud platform, the high performance network and rub cyber security framework from backbone of digital autonomous and institutional trust.

They are helping to shape it with their vast reservoir of unique data, the youngest talent and their bold vision for the future. This nation are redefining how artificial intelligence will transform our world in the decade ahead. The future of AI will not belong to a single region nor to the single model of de development. The future of AI will be multipolar. It will be diverse. It will be shaped by Africa, by Latin America, by AIA, by all nation that choose sovereignty and innovation. The next chapter chapter of a global technological leadership will be writen not only in global capital but in emerging city, research hub and innovation center across a global south. And as this new digital area unfold, one trust become clear. Those who invest in their people, their data and their sovereignty today will be the nation who lead the world tomorrow. Thank you.

I'm a CEO of Navia company. Today I'm going to talk about Genai, how it comes to our physical world. We are living in very exciting times. The times that start changing very quickly. We can see genai in various areas of our life. Today you have seen a dancing robot. You have seen giga chat today as well. But today I'm going to talk about physical AI technology and physical relay for the AI technology. 2025 was a major year of major shifts for our company. everything has changed the way we work, our technology landscape, our products but currently we do not see one even one commercially successful product. So today I would like to explain why that happens and why we don't see driverless cars on the roads. How many of you raise your hand? How many of you have come here on autonomous vehicle on driverless vehicle? Well, maybe I was the only one",

How many of you have come here on autonomous vehicle on driverless vehicle? Well, maybe I was the only one started in 2009 when Google launched its first driverless cars. For the first 15 years, the industry was very promising and exciting. all the industry said that in 3 years, every time they said in 3 years, the trucks will be driverless. We will go around by driverless cars. We're going to use driverless buses to commute to work. But unfortunately, it has never happened. Now, my task today is to tell you why we failed to deliver and why and how the industry has changed and what started to appear, what new developments we started to see as GEI us was ushered in this area. Now the industry in 15 years one slide more than $50 billion dollar were invested overall the US Europe China and Russia has create have created more than 10,000 driverless vehicles more than 30,000 research papers were published and there were zero commercially successful products and I want to talk just about that why that happened, how the industry will change and what will be the next steps. Before we go there, I'm going to show you a couple of videos. And I'm going to tell you why and I mean how the experts of the industry see these changes and I'll show you some of the leadersh and I'll show you what were their success stories until 2025. Andre Karpov very famous scientists he for some time headed AI in Tesla and he was one of the co-founders of open AI for about a 30inut drive around Palo Alto highways streets and so on and this drive was perfect there was zero interventions and this was 2013 which is now 12 years ago and it kind of struck me because at the time when I had this perfect drive this perfect demo I felt like, wow, self-driving is imminent because this just worked. This is incredible. , but here we are 12 years later and we are still working on autonomy. Andre, right? So, Andre is talking about how he was driving a VMA car in California in 2013. The car went around the town. They were driving for 30 minutes, made all the turns and he said imminent. Imminent meaning that okay like in a couple of years this technology will become ubiquitous because the car was doing everything. Google 2024 a way car an industry leader lost the the point. I'm going to talk about the the the maps later. It has lost it and you can see the person inside. Please bear with me while I am Yeah, I got a flight to catch. Why is this thing going in a circle?

Why is this thing going in a circle? I'm getting dizzy. It's Look at what it's I understand. I'm really really sorry, Mike. We're currently working with the situation of a vehicle. Is it circling around a parking lot? Right. It's circling around a parking lot. I got my seatelt on. I can't get out the car. Has this been hacked? What's going on? I feel like I'm in the movies. Scab calling from way to show. Right. And this is another favorite video of mine. I will I will let you know why why I'm doing this, why I'm showing all these videos to you. So, there's this guy with a stop mark on his t-shirt. And he found out that all these driverless cars stop when when they see when they see him when they see the mark. And my own example from my own personal experience, I went to China at the invitation of BU. They have one of the biggest autonomous car parks in in the world. 1,500 driverless cars in Wuhan. They showed me the technology, their cars, and 3 minutes later, this happened. The car wrongly detected an object and it drove into the solid lane markings area and just stopped. It thought it was standing at the traffic lights and it thought everything was fine. So, it's not detecting an issue. It's just standing there. It doesn't understand the environment, the context. It doesn't know that I need to go somewhere. It just stopped and wasn't budging. So a person had to to intervene and and start driving. Why is all this happening? Why are we and the whole world investing a huge amount of resources and time and money into it and we achieved this point where technology fails to solve banel simplest issues. Let's have a look at a couple of lines of code. It's very straightforward, a very simple scenario. It's based on an algorithmic approach. When we are writing a code, we we do this manually. Each action of a car is written manually as a code. It says here, if you see a pedestrian, stop. If you see another car, stop. It's very simple. But if we start writing code for everything that might happen in public rows, we can look at this code scrolling down for 15 years and there will still be more code. There is this term in the industry long tail. The longtail problem, what does it mean? First, it starts very quickly, very easily. As Andre Kvadov said in the video, he said 2012 in 2013, Google was taking leaps forward and there were driverless cars in the streets of the cities. They they took another step forward. They invested millions and millions. Okay, we have",

They invested millions and millions. Okay, we have arise? And then we have this guy with a stop mark on his t-shirt and the car fails. It loses its point. It stops unexpectedly and this is just San Francisco. So there are more and more scenarios coming up and you cannot code for each and every scenario manually. You can't code for anything that might happen in the world. You go from San Francisco to Moscow and you have new cultural context to to factor in new new signs etc. We've been writing this code for 15 years and we're still not finished. So presumably it's not even possible. But it's not that bad. We have a new approach based on Gen AI that I'm going to to talk about. We see that the industry is changing very rapidly since 2024 and this is one of the examples Tesla has started to deliver cars. You buy a car online, you click the button, you pay for the car, the the car leaves the factory, and it goes straight to your house. Tesla also launched this taxi service in Texas. They invested $5.6 billion. Wave is this new startup. from 2018 they started off the article called attention is all you need and they decided to develop their own software on AI algorithms. They decided to take Genai transformer architecture and decided to build their own software. And as of today or rather at the end of 2024, they announced that they would bring their cars to 500 different cities across the globe and then they will start the car and without any preparation the car will drive around each one of the 500 cities. Then BU started to scale up their business in China and so on and so forth. Those are just some of the examples. 2024 became a year of a lot of changes and disruptions. We saw that a lot of tech companies started to scale up their business very rapidly, changing very rapidly. Let's have a look at the changes. What I told you in the beginning, the algorithmic approach. Let's have a look at how it works. sensors have cars, radars, cameras. All of the information they collect goes to the block called perception, the perception of the environment. This block reads the information and sends it down the line to prediction and planning along with high accuracy information from maps and localization information. I highlighted the blocks called prediction and planning. When they worked based on algorithmic approach, you had to program each and every action of a car manually. I told you why that doesn't work. But it's not that bad. What Google started to do",

What Google started to do started adopting Gen AI models and they started integrating transformers into their technology. We took the problem fraud block, we integrated a transformer into it and started to train that block with a transformer and with information about human behavior. And then it started to handle complicated situations like accidents or unexpected emergency situations. But still the guy with a stop sign on his t-shirt is still a problem. Why? Because to solve that problem, the car needs to be able to understand the environment, the the world. The developers said, \"We can train the perception block to make it perceive that guy with a stop sign and make sure the car doesn't stop in response.\" We try to do this and we see that there is the stop sign. There is a person nearby just smoking a cigarette and the block perception says do not stop. The conclusion from this is that to solve the problem of self-driving cars and to implement this on Mars. next time I ask you this question who drove here in a driverless car. I hopefully we will see more hands. hopefully we will have had people who used Naio or or other cars. We need a technology that understands the world. This technology at the moment is VA as many companies including ours find promising. I will briefly outline out outline how this works and how we are creating this VA. We take 's model and based on this we create the VA model. So has giga chat the LLM model that works with language. Then the model turned into Giga vision. Andre Bft have talked about this today. This model is called VLM vision language model. We took that model, we fine-tuned it and turned it into VLA. What does it enable you to do? So, we do driverless cars, but this approach, this model can also be used to control robots, drones. You saw a dancing robot robot today. It's sophisticated model. You didn't see drones today, but you can imagine how they work. So, this approach works for everything. We apply this to transport but this architecture can be applied to any physical object. Let's have a look at the technology in more detail. How does it work? We collect big data from the world. text, audio, video, label data, data that we put into a car to make it distinguish between a person and a sign and another car. We pack it into a big data set, training data set. We fine-tune the model or we or rather we pre-train the model. it's a generalized model that you can use at a later stage to create applied technology",

We fine-tune the model or we or rather we pre-train the model. it's a generalized model that you can use at a later stage to create applied technology which we fine-tune with reinforcement learning and all kinds of things. lots of fine-tuning methods. I will not give you the details of the architecture because we do not have the time for it. We have a photo realistic simulator that helps us test and validate the models. But we also use synthetic data to train the model. Complex data from the world, Moscow, for example. I'm sure you've never seen a an elephant on the roads of Moscow, but in Thailand, you may see it. We don't want to go to Thailand and collect data there. Instead, we have the simulator. We can create or recreate this scene, this environment, and use it to train the model. And then importantly, this part called optimization and distillation. Before the model reaches a physical object, they work without connection to the internet. This model runs on a small computing unit to make sure it works efficiently with a low latency. We need to optimize the model and to make it small and and powerful. It's a very big area of expertise. And then this optimized model with the reasoning with the understanding of the environment can be used to control all kinds of physical objects. Navia used the model to control transport. Starting from starting in 2024, we started to integrate Gen AI into our solutions. We were doing mainstream cargo transportation and we had successful solutions there based on the algorithmic approach I talked about in the beginning. But we couldn't make our cars drive in the city. 170 driverless cars running around the city but not in commercial operation. This year we have done a number of breakthroughs, incredible technological breakthroughs. And now we know that this technology can help us bring our products taxi cars, buses, into the urban environment onto city roads. I'm sure you've noticed our bus, the shuttle bus. I would like to show you a video of it. It's not a mockup. We have several cars like this. We've been testing it. it is there driving along city roads. I want to show you what Genai enabled us to do in with our products. Heat [music] [music] [music] Thank you very much. A round of applause for Gregori Forestski. And now we have gained momentum to move on even faster. Next level is where robot uses millions and millions of virtual episodes to learn and confidently acts in the real environment. Embodied AI and use cases that mature first. Let's hear from Director of Maya Edu Institute, Jeffrey Tuantan with a report on from service robotics to embodied AI evolution and the future of AI.

Let's hear from Director of Maya Edu Institute, Jeffrey Tuantan with a report on from service robotics to embodied AI evolution and the future of AI. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Malaysia. So, I'm very glad to be here today and I'm even more happy when I saw the robots. So you still remember the humanoid robot that is locally made here in Russia and it excites the crowd and that actually excite me even more. Why? Because my presentation is very similar to what excite you. So I I believe that you you you will like it. Right? So this is my topic right? It's a bit technical. So from service robot to embodied intelligent the evolution and future direction of artificial intelligent. All right. So in simple term I'm going to show you like over the year AI has been transforming robotics research right and together they are actually making wonderful things as you saw in the previous presentation that actually a lot of this robotics technology once we add in AI and it come out wonderful things like what you saw just now in the autonomous car. Okay. So I'm going to show you more because that is what the stories that I'm going to share with you. So I'm going to start to turn back a few decades back to show you some background. So when I mentioned robotics maybe like 15 years ago. So everyone will talk about the one on the left hand side right. So that is basically robots in factory. Okay. So we call it industrial robots. Okay. So it depict it actually like somewhere in 1980s where we use a lot of robots and increase our productivity. So it is a a good creation of humanity and it brings a lot of value in our life. Right? But it actually do very repetitive thing. All right. So what I can say is like it is good, it is fast, it is strong but maybe not that smart. Right? So AI come into the picture. Right? So somewhere in between 1980s to 2000. So we start to think of like how to make robot more intelligent. Okay. So we have another new domain of robots. So we call it service robot. So we can compare between these two on the left and on the right hand side. Right. So the service robot basically do something out of what it's supposed to do because in this video the robot is basically not cleaning robot but instead it is actually interact with the customer which is this condition never happened in industrial robots right because industrial robot is designed exactly what it's supposed to do and does it right but for service robot it actually go beyond and it start to interact with human Okay, of course the first concern",

So we start to add more and more intelligent into robots and we create more and more smarts robots. So we can see from intelligent robot research that happen throughout the year throughout the world we can see a lot of robots start to get smarter start to get better and also we create a lot of new services. So for example in elderly care home right so or in like children home etc. So there are a lot of facilities that require human care but we are lack of this human label. Okay. Previously it is done all by human labor but now we have robots start to take over the position because it it it slowly acquire the intelligent that it can really fulfill the scope of the job. Right? So as you can see also in 2020s we have covid that make a pause of the world but that actually make a big push to robotics that we have seen like for example delivery robots. So robots start to help us to deliver our stuff not only deliver food, medicine in hospital and also a lot of other things. For example in hotel they start to take orders in restaurant and not only just basic needs as you can see on the right hand side lower we have very fancy thing like robot restaurant. So today we can see there are actually a lot like for example robot is making latte art for your coffee right and it's actually making much better than normal human being right so we can see once we add the intelligent part into robots this service robot actually can give good service to us human right so that is basically the growing part so now how we actually go moving forward from there. So a little bit background that I actually did this like 15 years ago. So when I joined this competition called Robocop at home. So it's a competition is a worldwide competition platform that is designed to call upon all the scientists all the researcher around the world that we discuss in a competition manner to see what or how we supposed to design",

So it's a competition is a worldwide competition platform that is designed to call upon all the scientists all the researcher around the world that we discuss in a competition manner to see what or how we supposed to design the robot that help us in our home environment. So actually without realizing I'm actually into what we call the embodied intelligent research direction. So from there we actually have from service robot now we are talking about embodied intelligent. Okay. So this is the competition setting. So as a comparison when I building the robots we can see that the robot actually have very similar component as a humanoid robots or or what we what we call it embodied environment embodied intelligent. So I roughly divide into this five parts. So you can see the robot brains okay which is well you have the robot intelligent plus the AI which is it involve all the AI machine learning cloud computing big data etc right then we have the eye okay the eye like just human eye so we use AI to make robot can see better just like how human being perceive the environment then also we have the mir which is like we give the capability using AI for the robot able to communicate with each other like us human communicate with each other right. So that is the human robot interaction and of course robot arms which is the object manipulation. So that is where we have physical interaction with our environment and with other human being. And lastly of course this one pretty much presented in the last presentation which is the robot leg which is the autonomous navigation. So now we know that robots actually able to navigate not only outdoor but also in indoor environment that it can move around just like us human as long as we have the maps as long as we have the coordinate system and so on which is today we have all the sensors that help us to do that right so these are all the components that slowly build up the embodied intelligent okay so from Here I would like to show you some example. So for example like in vision over the year you can see slowly last time I still remember when I was in school I use very primitive way to make cameras to take photos and to understand what is happening in the environment do pattern matching and so on. But as AI grow or AI advance today we have machine learning and even deep learning. For example, on the left hand side we have the deep learning model that actually help us to in real time understand what are those thing in front of you right and this thing can be trained to get very high accuracy that we can use it in the industry. So for example in the automated visual",

        "text": "we have the deep learning model that actually help us to in real time understand what are those thing in front of you right and this thing can be trained to get very high accuracy that we can use it in the industry. So for example in the automated visual side and this technology actually keep on advancing because today we have what just mentioned in the previous presentation the VLM visual language model that we don't even need to train right for a particular case but now if we can just connect to those big VLM that is available our robot can does understand what an apple look like all right or what a bottle look like etc. So it actually go very far with AI. Then the second thing is human robot interaction. So if you still remember in the slide that I show you the roomar which is a play with the babies. So that is a very primitive interaction right but today the human robot interaction is getting very complex as you can see on the left hand side and also on the right hand side whether is in a domestic environment like a old folks home or in a technical factory environment. So this robot actually have a lot of intelligence thanks to our large language model that it can actually interact. Also we have very excellent speech recognition and speech synthesis technology that enable this robot able to communicate very naturally with human nowadays right even maybe now you might realize that you don't actually feel weird talking to robots anymore right so we can see AI actually bring forwards this human robot interaction and I believe in future it is not weird at all when human starting to communicate a lot with human with robots. Right? So maybe I can also say that maybe some of you now actually can have a very lengthy chat with chat GPD or something like the giga chat. Right. Right. So of course the next thing is manipulation. So physical manipulation. So we have this mobileation. So in factory when we want to do some pick and place it is very simple because everything is control. We have precise measurement for everything. But in a home environment, it is a totally different story because your fork, your spoon, your plate in your house and in your neighbor's house are totally different. So how to actually precisely can manipulate all this object require very high intelligent and that is where AI come in and not only for mobile platform and even we can actually put on Lego robot that now manipulation done by robots can actually reach a lot of difficult challenges or task in mobile manipulation. So thanks to the AI that come into picture right so of course this is the the parts that I don't need to explain more because the previous speaker have already tell you a lot of stories so",

Right? So robot now is safely can move around thanks to the technology and also thanks to the advancement in AI. And even now we also talk about using large language model to make robot able to move somewhere with a very vague input. For example like please go to please bring me like a water right. So for example then the robot will understand like where to get a get a water etc. So yeah pretty much the navigation part is already solved thanks to the advancement of AI that is bring the robotics into another high. Okay but last but not least of course is the brain. So we have robot intelligent previously but now with enhancement of AI then we actually open up a new domain. So as mentioned by the brief speaker we have this what we call VLA visual language and action. So these are the three parts. So similarly like LLM. So we try to find the relationship between words. So over here VLA try to find the relation between visual which is the images language which is your our description in language and also action like how we do something right. for example, how you eat, how you walk, how you do something, how you tidy up the dining table etc. So we combine all these thing and we use the LLM technology, we use the transformer technology to find the relation between that and that actually help us to teach how robot able to perceive the world and do some actions so that it can complete some task. So over here VLA model is actually an AI model that integrate vision language action the anobbile robot to understand natural language command and execute task in real world but of course this is a very new research and state of the art and now a lot of debates still talking about world model how we should perceive how we should understand our world and so on and I feel that this is a very interesting research direction that's going on from now onwards Right. So let's come back to human or robots. So I show you a lot of this how AI actually empowered robots so that we can achieve what we call the and body intelligent. So when this thing we apply into a very special species of robot",

So I show you a lot of this how AI actually empowered robots so that we can achieve what we call the and body intelligent. So when this thing we apply into a very special species of robot look like human. So ultimately it come to what we actually dream on maybe next last time when we start to build robots. So as you can see these are some of work that I collaborate in Japan that they start to build humanoid robots to help in the production line. Okay. So over here is a food production line. So over here okay so just to to to confirm the one in the middle is robots and then the [snorts] one on the left and right hand side they they're robots okay right so it looks very similar now so this robot able to actually share the load try to understand how human pick up the ingredients so that they can assemble into a box of food right so that is some I think the first step that we try to introduce humanoid into a real use case that provide productivity or provide real value in an industrial setting. But of course ultimately we hope robot can actually help us doing our whole housework at home. I I believe that is what everyone that talking to me they are asking me when the robot is going to help us to like do their laundry, prepare their meal and so on. I believe everyone is asking that right. So we are working on that and now we almost have all the ingredient assembled and I believe in near future this is a very exciting development that is going to happen. Yeah, I I really hope so and and we try to work hard for that. So you can see with this platform we try to work toward this to make it a reality. But the last part of my presentation today I would like to show you another new domain. Okay. So we have robots that able to move around like human and in fact it is getting much smarter, much agile, much dexterity, higher dexterity etc over the day. Right? So as you can see the robot in front of you in the video and it is basically getting much stronger because like it can fall down just like normal human being but it can actually come backwards. All right just like human. So with that maybe another domain that humanoid robots can go into is sports. So we try to put this robot into soccer field and start to play soccer right and with that we actually open up a lot of new things that we are very excited to explore. For example it provide new form for research development and also education. So we can see the full body motion. Okay. And",

So a few embodied agent is going to fight against another team right. So it is a very high level and also perception the localization and the soccer game is a very exciting thing. So we have done it for the past few years and we put it in such a way that we want to see how far this thing can go and surprisingly it actually give a lot of very exciting result as you can see. So this video is the real video that we take okay with no telly operation okay and the robot just fall down and then it go back up and it continue the soccer game just like how we teach our young children to play soccer. Okay so this is a very interesting future that we really look forwards into it. I can see that when we do this it actually create not just a simple soccer game but it's a new world of sports and entertainment because for the past two years we do this we have attract a lot of sponsors the venues are put tickets are sold we have hundreds of millions of view online and more and more universities team are actually creating right so we become a new ecosystem for sports or robot sports Okay. So today it is just the very beginning over here. I would like to bring you this message that towards the new horizon of humanoid robot with embodied intelligent. Let's build the future together. With that, thank you. I'm Jeffrey from L Robotics Malaysia. Oh, by the way, this is the dance move by Michael Jackson. Just so you saw the moon walk, right? So that is what u we try to make the robot able to do it etc. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you professor Tan. Thank you. Now we know that future of artificial intelligence is in a good hand. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you Jeffrey Chan. Jeffrey Tun Chan. Round of applause again. Thank you very much.

A round of applause. Such a pleasure to be here. Thank you for having me. I wish I was right there in Moscow with all of you, but I'm glad to be joining virtually. And what a moment it is as we close out today, the second day in business at AI journey to be talking about what's next. It's such an interesting moment. In fact, these are the headlines from the news less than 24 hours ago. We're at this very paradoxical moment, isn't it? Market uncertainties are at an all-time high. It's okay. Don't pull out your phones just yet. It's a we can last 30 minutes without checking ticker symbols. And the reason for this is because we have built a large industry just in a span of three years. If you look at what's at stake, this is just the top AI companies in S&P 500. And the market cap of these companies, mind you, it's not even global, right? We're looking at $23 trillion in AI companies. So no wonder the markets are having a panic attack anytime we have any kind of movement and we have built this emerging industry with so many cross deals and partnerships because it's happened in the last few years just again in a span of almost 3 years since GPT was released by open AAI and there's good reason for this paradoxical moment because there is a plethora of tools out there. Again, this is just a snapshot by SEOA and we're not even touching on the majority of tools out there, but anyone who has seen or played with generative AI immediately gets a feel for how useful they can be. So, we're sitting at this very like it's tying back to the uncertainty. The markets are sitting on this massive capital and looking at where is the value. We have deployed this. Anybody using it can sense the value. But there is this massive discrepancy that also trickles down to the technology. This is Sam Alman himself and few days ago he's talking about how now we're at a phase where chatt can remove m dashes. you know the long dashes it always likes to use and compare that to his quote from January where it's like oh we we know we're on the path to AGI. So this paradoxical is it a hype? Is it not a hype? How can this be a hype? I can see the value. It's all interwoven and that's what",

I can see the value. It's all interwoven and that's what are massive companies out there many of them my clients deploying billions of dollars. JP Morgan has more than $2 billion in and this uncertainty this paradoxical moment has also obviously translated on the business side because while billions have been invested productivity has actually gone up the stark reality is that 95% of organizations 95 have seen zero returns on generative AI So the question obviously becomes we have invested more than 30 to40 billion in enterprise AI but what are these 5% of organizations doing right because this is the key point of this keynote which is that in order for us to see the returns on AI in order for this industry to keep growing and bring the benefits and power of the technology to full circle returns. We need to be looking at beyond LLMs. No matter which industry you're sitting in today, whether it's technology, healthcare, banking, manufacturing, energy, the way to get the returns on your AI investment is by integrating what I call emerging intelligence. And that's the key point today. I'd like to close out today by making the observation that it's not going to be a particular app or how we implement it or how we integrate a particular tool but sort of this larger looking beyond what's available today and getting ready to implement what's already in the pipelines. So we won't be discussing any specific things. What I instead want to do is to share a landscape view. We're going to zoom back a little and talk about three emerging waves. Each of these waves has a technological reason for it that we will cover. Each of these waves is solving a very real business value that is missing in generative AI today. And each of these waves is also going to tie back and bring full circle to the returns. And we'll wrap it all up as we end with like next steps and how you can implement this and what you need to bear in mind as you implement this. So I hope you're ready as we get started here with the very first wave. We just heard about this very interesting talk. The first wave is the embodied intelligence. So this is where we're taking the LLMs and going beyond, right? It's not just putting the capability of LLM into humanoid robots. It's much much larger than that. And this is just a snapshot of some of the US companies. Most of my talk is going to be geared and calling on examples from mostly US companies, a few Chinese companies. But bear in mind that everything I'm discussing is applicable globally. And these robots",

Most of my talk is going to be geared and calling on examples from mostly US companies, a few Chinese companies. But bear in mind that everything I'm discussing is applicable globally. And these robots for you know helping things around the house but also in machines in operations manufacturing playing sports. but they also come in many shapes and sizes like little pets little humanoid pet robots or sibling robots for kids useful for education. I mean wide variety. The reality though is that many of these robots are humanoids. are still being operated by teley operators and there's a reason for this because what is the underlying tech capability that we don't quite have yet? This is where the underlying tech that's being developed beyond LLM is world models. You might have heard this language being thrown around quite a bit. You might have also heard of the term spatial models. And the biggest difference between world models versus large language models is as these models learn on visual information, not just being able to predict on large quantities of text, which is the realm of LLMs. Now, this is going to be a huge step forward when we start integrating them more and more into our business because these humanoids, these machines are learning on real world. This is the physical world. It's not the abstract world of being predicting and creating content which has been useful and productive but they lack the realworld experience. It's more than just the physics. So when I see these things going around Miami and I know that there's a tele operator behind them, these are like food operator robots that you know can now see around the world. you're you're you the point to remember here is that not only are they adding immediate value right now but they're actually collecting the data that's required for the autonomous operation. So if you're thinking about from an investment perspective, the companies that are have the data records from autonomous operations from say driving and they're extending it to humanoids, they have a natural leg up because there's all these years and years and manurs of data that they can pull on to then apply. Again, it's more than learning physics. It's it's learning how humans walk around. It's learning how we navigate traffic. It's learning how the real world bumps and pebbles and rocks come into your workflow and how what do you do when you come across a human a child or a dog. This way of learning there are many ways the actual technology is being understood and learned. But this is a one of the older videos from Nvidia actually but it really explains one way we're teaching these robots to learn. Let's watch from physically based simulation and transfer zero shock to the real world. [music] The group model will enable a",

[music] So it can help with everyday tasks and emulate human movement just by observing us. Just by observing us. And that's part of the reason why many of these humanoids that are being beta tested or I guess I should say alpha tested in homes today have a teley operator behind them. They are learning and you're training the robots. And that is a new kind of partnership, a new kind of deal if you will that we're making with the world of embodied intelligence. The biggest ROI implication, what is this going to bring to businesses? What is this going to bring to the AI industry? Is in addition to extending the use cases by bringing them you know full circle into the homes into the real world being able to operate and do a lot of these tasks autonomously is that more importantly they bring the relevance and the context. Because if you look at where the value is really missing today in these enterprise implementations, it's not in the use cases. people are actually using them but they break when the real world context is not there anytime you actually apply it to an actual real world implementation. The second wave is that of embedded intelligence. So we're moving from embodied intelligence to the second one which is embedded. And in this we started seeing this wave you know pretty much a few months after LLMs were released you know any kind of device with edge functioning with edge AI right on them. These are meta's rayband glasses. So, with the tip of your finger, you have access to any of the LLM type tools. Play music or you know, ask it some questions like what temperature do you need to cook the chicken at? Or you can ask it to play back the conversation you just had with your wife to show her who's right? All are possibilities. But those are not the only ones. We have a plethora of single function devices. And you know at one point I remember when smartphones came around and you know nobody carried their watches and stuff anymore. I used to think wow that's just a single function device like who wants it? Turns out we do now because these single function devices from like you know language translator pens to earbuds that detect and prevent snoring so-called marriage saver or a smart mirror that tells you everything you need to know. These are just samples. I mean if you can put AI in anything, we are putting AI in anything. My vacuum talks back to me now. And the reason for this, right,",

I mean if you can put AI in anything, we are putting AI in anything. My vacuum talks back to me now. And the reason for this, right, that we're going to pull in full circle is that it's learning workflows. It's learning how to in real time how the human operates, how the devices operate. It's learning your workflows. And this way it can bring back what's really needed in LLMs and Gen AI today. Adaptability. We talked about context. We talked about real world. But getting the LLMs to adapt real time is one of the most crucial missing capabilities in technology today that's causing this big gap on returns in investment. This embedded AI doesn't just come in devices. You can embed it to current software tools. Let's watch. Hey Daniel, what's up? So, right here we have Messi. And this is the real Messi. This is not an AI avatar of Messi. This is the real Messi. But with face processing tools, language processing tools, direct face recognition, and customization, he's now able to talk in any language to your customers, understanding how they interact and increasing the amount and the depth of interactions you can now have with your clients, with your customers, with your different audience. This too is embedded AI. So it's kind of like a double level, you know, it's abstract as well as in devices. And that's the second wave that we're seeing. And the direct ROI, as I mentioned before, is now you're going to have adaptable models, moving away from static models that are only updated once in a while and take billions to almost a trillion dollars. Now we're looking at adaptable models that is learning from everyday mini tasks or mini functions. Which brings me to the third wave, executive intelligence. This is the big one. This is what differentiates the, you know, the leaders and the decision making capabilities of humans on everyday tasks where the minute it goes from something simple to something complex. This is when you're drawing on your years of expertise. This is almost human intuition. This can't just be boiled down to a step of rational if when this. But even if it could be boiled down to [clears throat] if when this, we don't currently have the tools for that. So this is the big one and a great example of this is how the UAE is has appointed AI as an advisory member of the cabinet. It was the world's first move. this AI will deliver strategic consultations, generate reports and conduct predictive modeling. So this was the vision like even two years ago I remember talking about this where we were talking about having an AI as a board member AI as your advisor and while this is possible",

So this was the vision like even two years ago I remember talking about this where we were talking about having an AI as a board member AI as your advisor and while this is possible lot of build and workflows and stitching together remember 2025 was supposed to be the year of AI agents this is where I was supposed to have been able to with one click of a button have my agent plan a whole trip bring my friends together book tickets, plan itaries, all with like one click. Well, this is Andrew Kaparthy, , one of the prominent researchers in the field, the the guy who coded the term vibe coding. And we are all realizing that it's going to take a whole lot more to bring agents, real world agents to the majority of people in the world. , and it's not as quick as we thought. Why? Because they lack intelligence. They can't use computers. They lack multimodality. They lack continual learning. And more importantly, they forget what you tell them. And this forgetting what you tell them is something we'll come out come back to over and over again. And perhaps we're seeing these gaps won't take a decade. I am I'm way more optimistic than Andrew when it comes to this. But it's also important to remember that these this is the reason agents haven't taken over quite yet. And the missing piece if you look at where in businesses a lot of our implementations are failing. It's not in people not using them. They're using them. They like the LLMs. But they are using them for simple tasks. At the minute we move to a complex task, anything that requires multiple people takes weeks, not minutes, anything that requires cooperation, multiple teams, this is where the agents are failing the stitching together. AI today is failing along along the seams and along the seams is where you need to be focusing on in terms of workflows in terms of what to build and in terms of extracting the value and this is where the technology is headed because you see the reality is LLM today live outside of time. What do I mean by that? you can of course ask you know your chat GPT or any of the LLMs you like to use the time it'll tell you the [clears throat] time by looking up you know the system clock etc but when you go into the world of LLMs it has no memory for example you can ask it to generate you know write a report a journal report on everything we did today but you cannot ask it without external workflows and having rappers etc etc you cannot ask an LLM today to write that journal report every night for you automatically and that's because they don't have this concept of",

These are all capabilities. Neurosy symbolic refers to when you integrate the neural nets that the current technology is based on with symbolic logic the if then else's kind of chain of reasoning predictive decision making weighted expectations scenario mapping and this is where we're going to start seeing the executive intelligence because this will achieve one of the biggest gaps today which is moving to complex tasks. This report that came out of MIT this year, just a couple of months ago, talking about how 95% of organizations see zero returns, also dives into why. Because on the surface, it might look like the biggest operational failure of generative AI, but not quite. Because 90% of people while they prefer humans for complex tasks for all the reasons we just talked about, they prefer AIs for simple tasks. So the $50,000 or more enterprise applications are failing to the $20 consumer apps and customers, I mean employees everywhere are using the AIs that they're used to. But the barrier for enterprise applications are higher because they've seen on the consumer side how easy it is how quickly they can increase their productivity. But somehow this productivity value is not translating to business returns and that's the gap we need to fill for the markets to calm down and start seeing how we can extract the actual value that is inherent in the technology. The second reason is that we're losing a lot of time and implementation results between when we investigate these apps to what's actually being imple implemented and once again here the consumer apps are winning in the enterprise use cases. So people are using it behind the scenes. So while we investigate so if you take something like chat GPT or publicly claude or any of the publicly available enterprise any of the publicly available LLMs they reach actual implementation 5% of the times compared I'm sorry 40% of the times compared to 5% for integra for generative AI enterprise apps hidden here is this story because building AI value hinges on going beyond LLMs and integrating them with this emerging technologies across embodied embedded and executive intelligence. It's only when we start bringing all pieces together, every little bit helps, but when we start bringing those things together, we're going to see this industry really solidify and continue to grow.",

It's only when we start bringing all pieces together, every little bit helps, but when we start bringing those things together, we're going to see this industry really solidify and continue to grow. AI gave us was that it achieved one of the holy grails of the field the field of AI which is what if we can command computers with the power of human language but language linguistics is just one aspect of human programming it's huge in in a way it's the operating system of humans but we need the real life context we need the world models we need the spacial models. We need the symbolic reasoning. We're not just language. And if we're trying to get anywhere near to human level intelligence, we need to look beyond LLMs. And whether, you know, we can just scale with more data, especially just textual data, that remains that open debate. I find myself on the other side of but it will certainly not hurt us to start investigating newer models and integrating more of these newer models because this is a very useful technology. Again pulling on just chat GPT because the numbers are so easy to assess and access. So it has more than 1.8 billion visits a year. We're coming up on the third year anniversary. It's deployed in over 161 countries. It covers 96 languages. And remember when you know they started out and they added 1 million users in five days where this is a quote from a tweet from Sam Alman just in March where they added 1 million users in one hour. So AI in many ways is really not a hype because anyone can see how quickly people are adapting the technology and how much we're using it. And we've moved past the days. And one of the other reasons organizational implementations fail is when they take months and months. Southwest has a fantastic example where they implemented they rehaul their entire crew management system, their legacy management system in five weeks and that was one of the biggest success cases for them. We're using this live and this is pulling from my client work. were designing hospitals of the future with one of the top architectural firms here. and even before generative AI, this was Rebo where we pulled up 40 new potential cures for 11 types of cancer. And this is one of the biggest points I can make here, which is that AI is larger than generative AI. And the more of the AI tools like predictive modeling, all the statistical information, basian analysis, all these tools that we can pull in and integrate it into LLMs, that's when we're going to really start seeing the real operational value in AI.

With the three waves, what becomes really important is that how we start navigating the space. And I think any things. , one is ethics and security. And I know we're going to dive a lot and we have separate sessions on either of them, but I want to quickly touch on these before we get to next steps and how you can integrate them directly. The first is ethics. Every powerful technology carries with it the potential for catastrophe. We've seen this over and over again. you know, from nuclear engineering to space engineering to mammals being cloned and every time we've had to navigate this with care. AI is absolutely no different. This movement in generative AI, what the industry is telling us right now is that we've moved past the attention economy that AI was built on, the social media world. This is a race to intimacy. And over and over again, if there's one thing we have learned from the past industrial booms all the way from the automotive industry or even the dot is that the businesses that succeed, there's always like a blossoming of companies, but the ones that really succeed and thrive are the ones that really hone in on the ethics and zoom in on what really matters and how you can improve human lives. And that always seems to help. Whether it's Ford or Google, they are still around. AI is changing the nature of fraud and the nature of human trust. If as a leader, as a decision maker, as a user, you can tap into this and be on the right side of this, this is where true wins, this is where industry building iconic companies are going to come from. AI ethics comes from each and every one of us and so does AI security. This itself is a whole new budling field at this point. , just a few months after Chadribute was released, , we had a Hong Kong worker in finance who thought he was paying out $25 million to his CFO on a live video call. And this is without any of the emerging intelligences. These capabilities already exist. , AI worms are out there. And this is Anthropic just a few days ago reporting on hackers that hacked into Claude to get access to multiple company documents and multiple sensitive information. And of course, one of the biggest issues that is typically underneath the scenes is that generative AI, all of the AI tools in ways they plagiarize because they're built on existing content. And the same thing will continue to happen with each of the emerging technologies because we're learning on existing data. So this is me asking Bing back in the day to write a conversation in the style",

And the same thing will continue to happen with each of the emerging technologies because we're learning on existing data. So this is me asking Bing back in the day to write a conversation in the style talking about two hitmen Jules and Winston sitting sitting in a coffee shop. And I love Quinton Tarantino. So as I'm looking at this I'm like oh my god I would watch this movie. It throws in a Bible verse and I'm like, \"Oh my goodness, I will definitely watch this movie.\" Well, turns out it's pulp fiction. And this is a really important point as we step forward because all of these devices, all of the models are learning on your data, which means it's a two-fold issue. one, you could unintentionally infringe on somebody else's copyright, but then at the same time, you have to be very sensitive about your information and have very direct clarity on what you're sharing because you're training these models. So that's part of the reason imple enterprise implementations have stalled because they're walking this really fine line. But the real secret is that as we look at the emerging intelligences that are coming out from embodied intelligence to embedded and executive, we're learning that whether it's world models or learning workflows or really learning true agency in order to integrate them into real value, we have to look on the shadow side. The shadows are there to teach us something to help us evolve. So we can't quite ignore them. It's by leaning in that you can awaken and build what you want to build. Shadow AI is an actual term and it refers to the fact that most people are using AI. 90% of employees are using AI in organizations whether it's been implemented at the enterprise level or not whether there's a policy there or not or even if they have an enterprise implementation how they prefer using the $20 commonly available tools because the barrier to them is less their tolerance to use them is less like it's it's just way more convenient. So this is what the shadow is telling us. Make it easy for them. In a way, this is the largest enterprise application of any technology or adoption of any technology that has been but it's failing when we try to do it officially and that's where the returns are missing. So this is a 5% playbook. As we wrap up here, in order to get your ROI on AI today, the first thing I would recommend is revisit your AI strategy. It's a fantastic time for it. And what you want to do is you want to build for friction, not for flash. So, most organizations invest their AI dollars into sales and marketings because it's easy to generate the content, but it's also easy to have direct measures like KPIs. You can",

So, most organizations invest their AI dollars into sales and marketings because it's easy to generate the content, but it's also easy to have direct measures like KPIs. You can what is the return, what is the click, but the real value is in the back office. And that was the biggest finding from looking at hundreds of organizational implementations this year. The biggest value is in the back office. So you want to build for systems with learning loops. You want humble AI, one that can learn and admit uncertainty. And you want to lean deeply into workflows. Companies that start recording data on their workflows are going to already have a leg up over the next year. And you want to buy not build. You want to work with external partners and bring in external advisors who have perview over the entire industry because AI in the fundamental models the foundational models are not built for any one particular industry. And the same is going to be true for the world models or the temporal or the neuros symbolic models. These are generalpurpose machines. So you want advisors because learning how it's implemented in one industry will give you a lot of insight into how it's going to be should be implemented for yours and it's time to start building differently. We don't want to just look at technology first. this question like what can AI do for you is one of the worst questions you can ask because it can do many many things for you and you don't want to also lean into the vertical what are the problems you can solve today you want to look at the vision you want to look at what is it that you can build that seems impossible and that is the recurring theme of the massive billiondoll and trillion dollar companies that are leading today and will continue to lead build for vision. So the main message I would like to end with is that every industry, every aspect of society is being transformed. AI just happens to be the face of that force and this transformation is going to happen regardless and it's through emerging intelligences that we can come back full circle to get the returns on investment.

Good afternoon, dear friends. , happy to see you all in the audience and happy to see everyone watching us online. members of AI alliance. I am here in a slightly different role. I'm here as a chairman of the supervisory board of AI alliance. It is a rotation role. Every year we have a new chairman. We can at least have a new chairman. [gasps] And we have gathered here today to talk about the way no let me start again to talk about how AI is already being implemented and we will talk about maybe not problems. They ask me not to say the word problems but challenges the challenges that we're facing today. You know, it's an interesting thing. We have leading companies and then we have companies that are overall interested but are not very good at it yet. When we look at the public landscape, it looks great. we have leaders who do everything without any mistakes, without any problems. They know solutions in advance. And then there are those who are lagging behind. So we have agreed with the colleagues that we will be talking about the challenges, the difficulties, the decisions that we've been making sometimes successfully, sometimes not. And to give this conversation a structure let's start with this bit of research or or a survey that we conducted within the alliance where we asked companies in industry that participate in industry clubs. We asked them what are the main limitations for AI use. more than 150 participants in the survey named the following key barriers. The first key barrier for large scale AI adoption is people competencies, culture, engagement, that sort of thing. Second, infrastructure, data, computing, security and cyber security. something that we need to talk about investment or return on investment. There's a dialogue within each company on how much you invest and what is the ROI that you need to target. How do you convince the financial services the the owner of the company that that it's needed? ethics, regulation, rules of the game, trust in AI and strategy, the goal setting from that comes down from the CEO and everything that has to do with the KPIs and organizational structure. It's hard to deliver results without it. We are beginning with barrier number one, people. Before I ask my question to Stanislav Luznuk, I would like to turn to all of the speakers and say that we have a free mic. We have known each other for a long time and so let's have a an informal conversation, an informal discussion.

You have a lot of data scientists and it looks as if you didn't have any talent shortages. I apologize to everyone here from Spare, but it feels like everyone wants to work for the yellow companies Tab Bank or Yandex. Okay, Sasha, we we've agreed to to adhere to the to the program. All colors matter. Yellow, green, even blue. Okay. what's the color of Cibour, by the way? Green. Oh, okay. So, we we're outnumbering them. The green ones. Okay. Stas, maybe you can answer the question. Well, thank you for for the kind words. I agree that One of the key questions, one of the key issues is indeed talent and people way. We are here to share experience. So the the problem of human capital is twofold. All technologies and innovations require people. people who we didn't start cultivating 10 years ago data scientists AI AI staff AI experts we can say that we do not really have such a big problem with people but actually we do have the problem because there's not enough experts they are cultivated not by educational institutions but rather by companies who invest in it invest in training but what we're lacking is people experts. I'm sure we'll get back to the educational topic, but that's just part of the problem. Another part of this human capital problem is leaders, managers who are often older and who often are unsure about the necessity to invest in this technology. So we are lacking people who can execute it and then people who can prioritize these issues do not do that sometimes in big tech in fintech companies. The top management and and linear management [clears throat] they may have a good understanding of what should be done about it but then there are companies who are lagging behind who do not have this clear understanding. all of these industries try to come together to to work out a solution. This will create demand and then the market will respond with supply with experts. I think this will give rise to a brand new industry. Back in the day, we had an IT boom and then IT integrators came out of it. I think this will be a similar situation. We will have consulting companies that will heed to the demands of of a company or an industry to automate this",

        "text": "a brand new industry. Back in the day, we had an IT boom and then IT integrators came out of it. I think this will be a similar situation. We will have consulting companies that will heed to the demands of of a company or an industry to automate this They will encourage them to to automate to adopt and increase value. So this will be a push towards creating talent and then we will be trying to retain all of these talented people here in Russia for all kinds of interesting tasks. I think it's it's fair but we do have the push. We don't have the people. I'm going to ask to comment on this. We have people from fintech companies, from Yandex, and a person from the industry. So what I'm hearing is that people from big techs, fintexs, you can engage all kinds of specialists. We do not really believe in it, but we have our own competition. But where do you find specialists of a good enough level without superinflated salaries. Basili, have you found an answer to this question? Yes, but the answer depends on how you ask the question. I would divide it into several parts. The first is that to develop AI, you need a platform. You can start by looking for people in the market to build it over a certain period of time or you can try to find a partner a big tech company or a telecom company or a similar one. This is our path and you can save time and money. and you in this situation you don't have to look for the people in the market. As St said, this model is attractive because you can replicate this experience to other companies not necessar necessarily in our own industry. It can be capital intensive industries with continuous production in in steel works for example. then again you need agents you need a lot of coding and for that you can use startups who are narrowly specialized to deliver specific cases. So you don't really need to hire these people as full-time employees. Next engineers we don't need that many engineers actually. I want to compliment people here because they are doing a great job cultivating these talented people. But it's it's hard to find your niche in the market, but you always you're always able to find people who find the tasks in your company interesting and challenging. and you try to engage them. And lastly, it's not just about IT people, but all kinds of technology people. You also need people in business units who generate ideas. You can't generate an idea on how to use an LLM if you do not know anything about an LLM. A few things help here to improve personal performance. people are pretty knowledgeable. They they like to expand their horizons. The vectors for using these tools can be manifold, but we need to be able",

They they like to expand their horizons. The vectors for using these tools can be manifold, but we need to be able use in the cloud for example? We need rules here in terms of changes in processes. in addition to improving your performance our company for example is very centralized when we were catching up with best practices and operational efficiency it was an advantage because you could replicate them fast now with AI the centralized model also pays off because it's easier to to replicate. I also wanted to add and add a compliment to civil because they are actively engaged with educational projects. When we were creating the central university, we're creating it for all our partners. It now has 60 partners there. Sibu was one of the first partners to answer the call and they're organizing all kinds of internships and training programs. They even have a co-working area there. It was as I saw rather easy for you because you you are used to engaging with the younger audience because you believe this is the right thing to do. Thank you. Thank you. I'm looking the at Tigran who who is who looks very appensive. Yandex was among the first companies to start working with data scientists actively with IT specialists. Tigran, how do you handle this? Do you experience any talent deficit? I don't live that far away from Yandex HQ or at least I used to right before you moved to a different place and I saw these many young people walking around with raspberry rafts. How do you retain them? How do you track them? Good afternoon. I think for all of us sitting here on stage and in general in Russia, I think we are not the ones to complain about staff deficit. We are at the top of the list of countries. top three, top five, top seven countries. Doesn't really matter the quantity, but at the top of the list, at the top of the rating of countries with a lot of super talented specialists. I think the colleagues will agree. It's it's just a fact. Yandex, Spur, , Tab Bankang, we all have a lot of, , great specialists. But, , speaking of problems, maybe we will discuss this today. In order to turn AI from a toy into something of actual benefit to humanity and yesterday we talked a lot about this problem where the children do their homework by delegating it to AI. So it's it's harmful rather than beneficial. It's a harmful toy. So how do you turn it from a toy to something useful and beneficial? Specialists, experts, people who are passionate about it, driving forward thousands and thousands of projects across the country in fintech in Yandex as well.",

The ability to say that yes in our company, in this business, in this line of work, we are achieving a significant share of benefit thanks to AI. So how do you motivate people? How do you retain people? I think you you you deviated hugely from the answer. It's I think it's obvious whether you are at the center of it or just a bystander. I'm sure you will agree that we are witnessing maybe the biggest technological revolution in our history. not not smaller than computers or internet or smartphones and that alone is is more than enough to motivate people I think and I think it's motivating all of us sitting here as well we've come here because we're motivated because of it we have alpha and spur right I select alpha okay our brand color is red. The first deputy chairman of Spurbank you know actually you know Zur is flanking this panel discussion. The red one is in the center and the representatives of yellow colors all the rest and yeah the the green one is here obviously. So anyway, sorry. the the people how do you plan to retain people? AI unfortunately is an something very expensive. I mean only [snorts] big and efficient corporations like the corporations that we represent can engage in AI. There's no problem with with talent. Russia [snorts] has a lot of talented people and all of us were able to learn how to build great office spaces with food courts with fitness centers. 20 or 15 years ago, even a decade ago, that was absolutely outlandish. But now it is a standard and now we compete for these people. We pay high [snorts] salaries. But this is kind of a the common thing. You cannot retain people with that. But I think culture is the most important thing in cibor and yandex in bur and tbank. The culture is special. for us we're building the culture for the smart ones and the free ones. And not everyone are in line with this culture but those who get there [snorts] they these are the you know the creative young people who who are there who are in line in Yandex. Tigran, he's a very big boss at Yandex. Have you seen him on the street, you know, he's was just he's just using the underground, the metro, and wearing a backpack, you know. And remember my colleague from another bank comes from S-class Mercedes and me too. I came on a on a car on a fancy car and you know but he just said okay bye guys and just jumped in in the tube.",

I came on a on a car on a fancy car and you know but he just said okay bye guys and just jumped in in the tube. Yeah, it is a different culture. But I think the digital leaders in Russia now have exciting tasks and their own authentic culture and you know that goes outside of the box of smoothies and fitness centers and you know I mean this is how these digital giants work. Thank you. What about Zur? What's burb bank to to retain people? What are the things you don't know about that? Well, you know, I'm asking you as a president of the supervisory board of AI alliance. You know, I would build on that question and I will talk about a challenge. You know what we are facing right now? We are developing fundamental models based on these models. Right now we have more than 500 initiatives. These are the teams that are actively developing the products and as well as the agent systems across the perimeter of ZBAR. And then we can see that when we start to create this agent system, data scientists are not interested because do you need to train the model? Okay. No. Okay. You'll work it out yourself. developers u also not very excited and they say okay I mean something complicated code something challenging code that would be great but like do something routine with the model no that's not interesting not exciting but neither of these can finish and complete the task because sometimes you need to optimize the speed the model to properly work with the data and you know this is kind of an area that is between the two areas between the two industries. So neither developers nor data scientists can do it properly by the way. So you know during this year we were investing in some patterns. If you start if you look at the start of the year there were no best practices on how to implement these large systems in the large corporate landscape. It was just some simple cases like developer chatbot. But if you talk about the serious landscape with the scalability with reliability, the speed security and trust there were no frameworks like that. And basically for the entire year we were experimenting you know with trials and errors you know some we're looking at some cases and we're trying to understand what works what not when we understand that something works in a stable fashion we try to share it because the knowledge and the [snorts] scales should be shared across the market. I do not want to say it's a new profession but this these are new skills for the new profession you know I remember the era when we the mobile apps was just started to be developed you",

You just have to learn it. We say another example on the profession because a year ago futurologists were saying that prompt engineer will be the new profession will be a new job. I mean a year ago they were saying this is going to be a totally new job and now it's it's laughable really. If anyone has hired prompt engineers, you don't you can fire them. they don't they're not needed. So I agree with TIG runs something that happened during my entire career in technologies and these skills you know they are totally new they're very exciting and we are exchanging information in terms of how do you find people who are doing these things I can give you an example a son of my friend is studying at the higher school of economics He got the internship at Zur without my participation by the way and he calls me and asks okay where should I go in Yandex in search or driverless vehicles. He says this is a cool organization and I they give giving me the middle pos level position and I say well go to the to the search I would go to the driver as well or you are motivated to work in the bur. I have I have I've have heard your presentation. I mean, it's the general thing and I would say that it's a good it's something good here because we train young people and they're here and I would like to thank everyone present here in terms of for what are they doing for their learning and I would ask maybe to you know to say what what is your contribution to the market? You're talking about the new talent, right? Tigran that's an exciting and promising story. Yandex for many years for like more than 10 years have been investing in the data analysis school. I'm not going to be humble here but today I think on the global landscape it's one of the top MA programs for data scientists in the world and same this the data analysis school is not fully connected to Yandex I mean some people graduated and go to other companies the graduates I think like onethird goes to Yandex we have many graduates working with Burr by the way",

Yeah. Because because this is a top of the top really. We have a joint project with Spur AI 360. This is a specialized program based on the a number of top Russian universities. Together with Spur and these universities we are selecting these students who are excited about that about AI and they have a good foundation. They have good mathematical skills and this is a specialized educational program for these kids I mean for the students. I can talk about that at length. We have our own analysis school and we have a joint pro program with spur and many other programs. So with other universities, I think all the other panelists will join me here because the Russian financial companies have been investing a lot in the education and have been doing that for a number of years. So this reversal is really something that is happening. I think that it used to be the case that it was the priority and now it's AI and the new programs are focused on AI exactly on AI. Thank you Stanislav. you know why big tech or fintech in Russia is great because we have some excitement and drive to do something new and [snorts] as CR is saying you know we are living through the revolution and this we're having this paradigm shift and as paradigm shifts happen the new products appear and if you're a large company you have this effect from the operational involvement you know you have in implemented something you improved something by 0.5% and you got like billions saved or and whatever. So we have a lot of tasks and when young professionals join our team, you give them this task, they can experiment and create something and I think this is very important because that really drives the skill to to learn and we have this full layer of AI native employees, engineers. It's I mean they are now u being trained not by universities but by IT large IT companies and many companies started to invest on the level of schools and competitions. Yandex school [groaning] Yandex MA program is fantastic. We have a lot of employees from that school. We had a couple of courses on fintech and coding and now we have launched a big central university project. The main idea is that we grow product experts, analysts, developers, ML experts who know how to leverage the the today's knowledge to improve the process and products and in all areas in all industries.

All AI is based on mathematics. Coding as well just to learn mathematics. This is the best science in the world. Yeah. You know the mathematics is the is the queen of all sciences. I understand this is this is true. Yeah. I mean those who are adults now you know this is true. I mean in school we thought that teachers were just saying something that was not important really but now it remained to be true. Yeah. Same was for me. You know I have two daughters. my one of my daughters is in university and she's like she says okay I'm I'm I'm a humanities girl and she went to the high school of economics and she's studying advertising and I remember one evening very late at night I asked her what are you doing and she says I'm writing an ML code for an API for telegram channel and I said well sorry but you're in an advertisement And I and she says, \"I hate artificial intelligence. I just have to do it.\" So anyway, the the the point of the story is that you will have to learn AI whether you want it or not. [snorts] Yeah. You know there is a we open sourced Giga agent. We put it on Git verse. It's an open source system. It's very simple. you can ask it to you use the data to train a small ML model and use it in your work. So you have an agent that is based on fundamental network but within itself it can do something being a pretty good data analyst and can train another ML model and you it can train the model to answer the questions. I will I will to I will say that to my daughter not not now maybe I mean she has to learn some Python skills. Yeah. Well, since we are talking about children, boasting without children, you know, my son is is in school. He's 17 years old. And he says, you know, I can now code websites with AI. And I say, [snorts] well, try it out. And in two days, he comes to me and says, well, I earned 10,000 rubles. And I say, well, you know how to earn money now. It's hard work. And he says, \"No, it's just like took me half an hour.\" And you know, whatever we talk about, whatever we say about gadgets and widgets and AI, I think that people will adapt and our children will be stronger and smarter.

And if we talk about our contribution the contribution of Alpha Bank in the development of the youth guys at T Bank created a central university fantastic thing fantastic project huge respect now this [snorts] is like a approach to dive deep you know to select the best guys and to train them. Yandex is doing the same. We have decided to unite all of our initiatives in one platform. It's called Alpha Future. it has been online for a year now. I mean it does not have we spent billions of rubles. We have we partner with 300 universities around the country including ITMO in St. Petersburg and many other universities and schools as well. And our team loves that because they tour the schools and universities and they get motivated giving lectures. So we decided to make it a you know wide scale large scale project and it's great that in our country we have big tax fintech and you know very large digital corporations that can help us to move this technology forward and to unlock human potential. Yeah. Vasili was kind of looking at us and watching us, watching our discussions and I think in the industry you need to have some specialized technical background. Yeah, I want to say that the engineers who are going to look at that I mean I am I wear two hats you know and I have one of the hats is the alliance of specialized professions and for example there we discuss what program should be selected for chemical engineers and I think with the special education we were able to achieve some greater results. we have formulated what we need for the higher education. But the future engineer should know how to use models for the modeling of the production line. Should know how to use drones or other driverless vehicles in the production. They need to understand how to use predictive diagnostics and together the community of the businesses and the engineers and the state institutions we have developed the programs to make sure that engineers can use AI in their everyday world. Yeah. Talking about the education, we said that we invest a lot in education, but the question is not about the money and the investments, but the question is about the talent in the educational program in the educational system.

So you know it's like raise someone who will be like you great motivation. I think this will mean that there will be a lot of demand and there is a lot of demand for these lectures of these professionals sharing their knowledge and their practical skills. Yeah. Now that was something that I would like to comment on as well. In Yandex we have 30,000 people half of them are engineers and 960 employees of Yandex and this is not their direct responsibility. It's not in their job description but they give lectures and seminars. They also create training courses and training materials. 960 people pretty much in their own time outside of their direct responsibilities engage in training in this activity of humanitarian value. And it also increases the value of an employee within the company because there are people who enjoy teaching. and in addition to just doing a good thing, they display this loyalty to the company. Friends, to avoid turning the session into a session on just one question because we have 38 minutes ahead and four sections to discuss, let's maybe speak up a little bit. The second barrier from the survey is infrastructure. Three main problems here. Problems with the quality of data, lack of computing powers, computing resources and cyber security. Let's start with cyber security. An unexpected turn or maybe data. No, cyber security. a brief poll. When we talk to our corporate clients and tell them about AI transformation, mid-level management say that's all good and fine, but we have cyber security the cyber security department that say no, it's too complicated and then that there are a lot of nuances. Is it going to be in the cloud or on prem? And this dialogue happens in every company at Spur as well. Obviously, it's a difficult discussion. What do you do about this? You are the decision makers of your companies. How do you delineate between moving forward, progressing forward and being open-minded to the adoption of models, experiments with models, new data, etc. and the requirements of cyber security. Anyone please let me begin. I think It's akin to this question when did you stop drinking cognac in the morning? Artificial intelligence or the transfer of data to AI is in no way a cyber security issue. I mean there's this big problem. There is a a revolution happening. Everyone understands that you can optimize business significantly. It requires",

I mean there's this big problem. There is a a revolution happening. Everyone understands that you can optimize business significantly. It requires solutions. None of them has it. There is no single out of the box solution that you just install and there you have it. No, I mean you can and alphab cyber security comes up. the cyber security team that say this these data cannot leave leave the perimeter of the company and then it all goes to the CFO because the CFO starts asking questions why do you need this? and the answer is I just want to run experiments and experiments cost tens of millions of rubles. For example, Gigadhat published its huge LLM with 700 billion parameters. How much does it cost to simply run it? 700 billion. That probably cost you tens of millions of rubles, right? You're right. But we have a better idea for the colleague you're describing. there is this TV show called severance you know it so we have decided to implement this sort of severance we have giga chat the public giga chat you go there and then it asks you you are you using your corporate account or not if you're using your corporate account you can work with all kinds of corporate data corporate files presentations excel spreadsheets etc it's a separate environment it it has double hemisphere is a corporate one and a personal one. The interface is the same, but it's just this delineation. I understand there are several companies in Russia, Sp Yandex, some other companies that provide cloud-based infrastructure, but it's it's a deadlock. Unfortunately, cyber security does not allow you to transmit data outwards. What can you do with this? I I have no idea. I've been discussing this with one CEO of a big company and he says I can't imagine it either. and also all frauds happen with social all data leaks happen as a result of social engineering. When we overcome this barrier I and I hope we will because this is a very serious barrier. I hope everyone listening to me today and doing cyber security in their companies information security we need to sit down and have a serious discussion and revise our approaches but when AI is implemented when it starts making decisions that's when in reality we'll have new tasks the tasks of securing your business securing your people from decisions already made by AI so I suggest We invest all of our bio intelligence into trying to solve this problem and not trying to solve the problem of someone stealing a terabyte of data from some machine or create a model train it and then someone steals it steals data. from a temperature sensor from the cloud.

The cyber security problem is making look at an LLM. What is an LLM? It really is a large model. One server processing data with B200 maps for example. You can use it to place an ultra model one model. And then this paradox comes up. It will be working way slower in this configuration than it when you place it on a super pod with several dozens of pods, several dozens of nodes and then transfer into the cloud is inevitable. You can buy one server. It costs roughly 50 million rubles. You can't work with just one. You need to have a backup. And then the check is 100 million rubles. But but you can have a cloud and a reliable cloud partner that can help you scale up your infrastructure and you pay only for what you use and it will be cheaper and faster. So at the end of the day, cyber security indeed should be looking at how you make this secure and importantly it can be done much faster. You can start using it tomorrow and can run your experiment not 6 months from now but but tomorrow. When I hear about cyber security I hear we need to close everything and no data should leave the perimeter. But when you're doing something new once again you don't have an out of the box solution that you just install and everything is running fine. You will inevitably have mistakes and you need to have some tolerance to these mistakes. You need to use the mistakes for learning but you shouldn't use it to limit to restrain to put barriers for companies for infrastructure because it will slow down progress. Another thought speaking of cyber security I've recently had this discussion with our IT security team and IT security is about bots fighting among themselves. fraudsters can use all kinds of data sets, all kinds of models and they're using them for their attacks. Our security should be on par with them. If you have prohibited everything and then the fraudster uses some latest development to attack you, you will you will fail. You will not be able to repel the attack. And then again, you need to make AI based solutions, Giga Chat, Alisa Chat, GPT, and the rest available to your employees. I'm talking about our experience. you can slap them on their wrists and say don't go there, don't use that. But what we do is that we have about 80% of employees using these AI based solutions daily. We have our internal solution that is an aggregator of all kinds of models and then you go there to use our model or you can use a",

No, you you you cannot transmit that data. So that's that's our workaround. You can use anything but there is this initial filter that gives you recommendations. please do not upload, do not transmit any critical sensitive data and that becomes a habit. more and more people are getting accustomed to it and yes it improves our efficiency. The topic of cyber security is a very important one, increasingly important one. It's not a premium. It's a crucial responsibility. There is this agent fever emerging and we will have social engineering of an unimaginable scale. So yes, we do need to do cyber security in the same responsible manner as as we do everything else. Sex security in our case is a part of agile, a part of other technological processes. And also I think that as AI develops, cyber security is becoming a much more important challenge, a much more a much more interesting area for mathematicians, for talented young people and maybe it will be even more prestigious. it's it's a cutting edge area with more and more innovations. So we do need to focus on it as much as on aggressive technology development. Half of the audience here presumably supports cyber security passionately and the other half is more liberal about it judging by the applause. What about the industry partner Vasili? I have a different perspective. There is this constant war between IT and security. I and S you mean? yes, they cannot do without each other. But that said, despite this war, as a person who is with the IT crowd, not the S crowd, I would like to put on a different hat. There is the question about what data you can transmit to the cloud. Yes. And then security can say give us a a list of types of information that we need to keep secure and then we'll give you the the secure measures. And so you go to business and ask them what sensitive data is for you for your area. so my observation is that it's the the the business people who are more rigid about this. The first thing they say is we cannot we can't transfer any kinds of data. All data are sensitive. Okay. But what if we anonymize it? What if we use masks etc. Another observation is Can you make can you ask AI to make a decision and then roll back two aspects to it in a lot of areas you can you can do a co c co-pilot you can use a co-pilot",

I can do selective review and see if AI has been making good decisions and then the price of a mistake is very high. you need human involvement at each step of the way to guarantee security. A designer of any technological capacity clearly includes foolproof [snorts] means It has measures that protect you against all kinds of risks and mistakes. It's it's not that simple to just push a button and everything collapses. And lastly, I think it's about a psychological barrier. Many companies have this bias against clouds. I think it's becoming less and less of a problem. platform. You can use a preconfigured platform cloud-based platform and many people are opting for that instead of building something in house. and also what people are learning and and learning to use more and more mechanism is when you get a standard mechanism, it reduces the number of arguments between the IT crowd and the security crowd. Thank you. , let's put a pin on it for now or or maybe someone else has a comment. It's it's a it is an explosive subject. It is indeed. Another explosive subject is finance. Maybe not as much as cyber security, but still it's common place and grant described it. I think not in our companies obviously, but in some other companies, a person comes to you and says, \"I want to run an experiment. I have this great idea, a neural network. , it will ignite. It will be great. Give me some money for for this. And the answer usually is , come back next year. We don't have the budget for it just yet. My question for the participants of the session is rather straightforward. How do you how do your companies make these decisions? You specifically are the people who have to answer these questions who make investment decisions. How do you make them [clears throat] based on your take on the efficiency of AI? And what would you recommend to people to executives who are only beginning to make decisions on AI and for whom an investment of 50 million rubles is a material one? Andre. Yes. , how do you do it at Burbank? Please let us all know. I have this thing to to to give me a hint, a rule book, a case book. Yes, it's a great thing. The alliance companies helped publish this book. we would like to thank Alphab Bank and Yandex and Spare",

The alliance companies helped publish this book. we would like to thank Alphab Bank and Yandex and Spare This is about how you convince the CFO that AI gives financial effects. But life is usually more complicated than that. And usually we make decisions not just based on a leaflet. And this book, this this rule book combines all of our collective experience. But still we have a certain threshold where we decline projects that do not meet our criteria but criteria can vary right. I have some practical recommendations in order to progress towards economic effect and profit and ROI is a fundamental investment. If you want to invest in your own fundamental models, no, sorry to interrupt. If you want to train your own foundation models, the recommendation is do not do that. Use the ones by Yandex or Spur or or some other models. , train them, fine-tune them, but do not train your own basic model. Yes, thank you for that. So, that's that's the first threshold. Just don't don't do it. And there's this other thing. How do you evaluate the effect? How do you decide whether to invest on it in it or not? two perspectives. First, how do you estimate the effect? How much will it give you? Very often there are cases where you will not know unless you try. In this case, you need a hypothesis and then you use statistical methods for comparison. You need some ground truth where you know how much it cost you to do something today. If you don't know it, you won't be able to assess the potential effect from implementing something. This needs to be some basic truth. You test it and then you see whether technology gives effect. We have this complicated discussion on tools for developers with certain metrics. We know how many hints we can create how many lines of code you can you can you can write what is the effect on the economy. One of the approaches that we've been using is we measured two teams with the same skills. How much time it will take them to perform a task with or without the system agents and then we drew conclusions with a certain samp sampling that yes there is an effect and we know how to measure we can make decisions based on it. So you can make research, you can make comparisons and an internal AB tests, but you need to know how much does it cost today. The second story is a bit more complicated, but it is inherent with any technological transformation stage. If you have one process and you want to improve it and speed it up, you'll get an increment. But sometimes it is measured by point something%. If",

If you have one process and you want to improve it and speed it up, you'll get an increment. But sometimes it is measured by point something%. If that's that's a lot. Why the process is not changed? Because well, it's the same. Yes, some of the stages of the process were removed or made more less costly, but the nature of the process is the same. On the other hand, when you start to fully redesign how to do it, if you are able to do it as an autonomous generative system, but then you have to rethink the entire process, how the product is built, how to make it totally different from the very start. And this is where we can have effects and we can see it in several areas. You have multiple fold effect and you can do something that you were not able to do before. billions of rubles of effect was the effect of some of the projects. We were not being able to physically do that because we needed armies of employees really a lot of employees and then we started to do it with generative AI and we got that great value. So are you adding something with AI to the existing process or are you building them from scratch based on AI? Thank you very much. very exciting you know budget process and you say like okay you are removing some initiatives from the list of the budget with your pen or your pencil should I be honest or not of course not honest we have models with AB tests every effect every project gives us billions well it's the same for us yeah everything works great I think is more of an art rather than the science. It's maybe management science. But how do we distribute technology investments? 73% of all investments this year in technologies are AI related projects, tens of billions of rubles. And then the longer the technology lives the more precise the metrics are in the calculations. Well that's what's required. And on the early stage I have this rule. I say okay if a developer has a better productivity of plus 5% how much money will we get? Well this will be the amount of money we will win. Okay let's go and do it then. And when you cannot calculate it at least approximately I mean those who just started to invest in AI they are lagging behind but you can can calculate that that value that AI will bring. I think the strategic management task is to put this strategic tasks.

I think it's an effective way. Absolutely. Because there is also I mean a good as well. There are only three companies in Russia who use Chinese models or American models. Our alpha gun platform is using that and we cannot afford not doing it. Have we calculated the ROI? Well, never. But on the strategic level, you understand, okay, we need to invest this amount of money, but you can't calculate the ROI. when the technology just start in its lifespan you can't really understand what it life what its contribution is going to be but after some time yeah you can calculate the metrics and the ROI great experience thank you Sennislav well first of all we don't have budgets you don't have a budget yeah you know this process when you like remove something from the budget list budgeting list with your pen you know this is how our company works Secondly, we have discussed information security and we said okay this is not secure that is not secure. If the finances are not calculated properly, you can burn burn billions, millions of rubles with AI. Even a junior employee can just, you know, burn through 100 million rubles with AI. But you know it's great that large companies exchange experience on how to measure the efficiency of AI and how to calculate properly what are the approaches to make sure there are no mistakes and if we talk about how we make decisions basically there are two effects of AI implementation direct efficiency we're a large company with a lot of transactions and operations and clients and we have a constant change process. So the improvement of unit economy and thanks to AI we can have a we can improve that constantly and our rule is simple all investments that we put in this year should have an ROI next year. So every year we have to have an return on the investments of the previous year and we have been living within this paradigm for the last 10 years and it works. I'm sorry but okay you you started to develop your almost your own LLM. Do you expect to have a return on that investment next year? Well first of all we haven't started developing our own LLM model. We're not so rich. Well first of all they don't have the budget right. Yeah. So we took an American model, then we closed it. Then we took another American model, then took an Chinese model, trained it for the Russian language, and you know, it kind of did the job. But training model is very complicated and very expensive.

You know, it's billions, a fancy thing to do. So yeah, we took a model, we tried to train it. fine-tuning the model is much easier than developing a new one. But the approach is that okay, next year we should have a return on that. And it kind of works. If you look at the expenses, they're increasing. They're doubling every year, but we still see the effect. So the direct operational expenses are saved. an example to prove that there is some life there. There is some potential but great it's great when this technology delivers a new product. You know this paradigm shifts creates new products and here it's really hard to make a decision because you have to jump over your head. You know you're going to make a product and it's going to be popular and these investments are going to be returned to you. Now this is a more difficult but we were able to make such leap forwards. Not always do we succeed but we have this culture in the company that people are not investigated if there make an error but if you increase the expenses twofold then but you will have return next year then you can do that and to drive the business. Oh, Stannislav since he's a very humble guy, , he actually initiated this methodology and this panel. This is true, St. Thank you very much for that, Tigran. I don't think we have a lot of time, but I'll be quick. I think that we're discussing education. Education is very expensive. Very large companies are working on the education. I think those who are here they are [snorts] concerned about how to use AI and if you were not able to create a lot of problems by yourself you know like cyber security and other things let's just give a check for 50 or 100 million rubles and you just connect it and for 1,000 rubles you got the access right now to the cloud based Russian or nonRussian services and you know there's like a lot of free stuff as well and he started to experiment that's very important I think the main problem the main barriers human related first of all we discussed security that was the first topic secondly people are concerned they're concerned with what automation is given to people who are proficient in some area and you know people are saying, \"Okay, Alexander, automate what you do.\" And you think, \"Okay, well, , if I'm going to automate my my job, , I mean, maybe as a captain, you're going to be removed and automated being the last one.\" But they say,",

So you have to change and break this mentality in the companies. I don't have a recipe on how to do that and in Yandex we have this problem as well. It's kind of obvious we are all humans and so you're kind of thinking whether you do need to automate this thing or maybe not. Maybe it will threaten me. So yeah, that's it. Thank you. st well you know just that we don't have enough monies that's why we just do training readym made models Chinese models and yesterday announced that it will put its models to open source. There's not a lot of companies in Russia even in the world who can develop their own models. So the fact that there is the open- source models that are being made available and that are fine- tuned for the for Russia for Russian language, this is a boost for people to have some effect and to fine-tune these models and to have the effect on the on their business. So yeah, you can test drive this and you can make some errors, you know, some errors. It's easy for us to talk about errors because if we make an error in our financial industry, maybe no one will notice. And what about you in chemical engineering, chemical production? If you make an error, might lead to some major consequences. Well, since AI is a priority, the higher the level of the top management made in in a decision, the more prioritized it gets. So, we created a special high level committee and we make decisions there. It is categorized in three categories. Like for example there are some projects that help to decrease the expenses on the logistics or procurement and I mean these are the projects with understandable business case. The second category are enablers like smart search when we say okay we believe in the fact that if employees will have access to the information to other parts of organization it would be very good for them it will be very effective and the third one is infrastructure I have already told you how we made it how we make it less costly but we're not creating our own models it's not a lot of money that we invest in that so it's not a pain for an organization.

We have just five minutes left in the large topic that is called the strategy. Here we're talking about the organizational down to that. How do you need to change the organizational structure? What KPIs do you need to put to make the AI implementation work? Let's start with you Tigran. One minute. Well, no recipe here, no silver bullet. All organizations are different. It's hard question how to change the organizational infrastructure. But based on my experience, you have to have a pressure from the top. As Vasili said, the top management should be committed and want it themselves. They should not I mean they should walk the talk really and be very driven. So that's the top down pressure that should be present. Then through some tools it should go to a KPIs. There should be some recruitment limits. the professions, the jobs that should be automated should not get this new people. You know like when someone wants to increase the membership of their team, the headcount of their team they their actions their activities should be assessed within the company. There should be the goal to create an infrastructure so that the company can make this experiments. If you don't have that infrastructure, if you immediately fall down, then nothing will be achieved. this year for 2025 we have a special award to the employees for various optimizations that managers supervisors can give this money award to an employee if they implemented some optimization. Neural geese is something that we have a special award, non-monetary award. If you have done a project for optimization or creating a new pro product or a some new process optimization and we have an award ceremony and people have upvoted and these are the tools that are needed. And the last thing is that you have to keep a breast of what is happening in the world because we are just on the at the [snorts] start of the journey. We have the problem of the white sheet. you have a paper, you have a pen, you don't know what to to write and it's like a computer with no files in it. Thank you Stannislav. Okay, I'll be quick. The top management have to believe in this technology because if they do not know how to use this technologies, the competition will eat them up. The young people have to be involved and give them the right for experiments and tests. You have to be tolerant to their errors because you can't do without trials and errors and you need to start with the high school with the first years at university to give some tasks because if a young person joined your team they're open they they have an open mind and",

Thank you. I do agree with all of the words of the previous speakers. U the most important thing is that we have AI in in action committee. This is the the committee with a lot of weight actually used I mean we have been living through this AI trend for a couple of years but as saying this is just the start. So we're not talking about some specific KPIs but we have a common excellence center. The head of this block is of this section is going to sign some memorandum I think. So everything related to that is there is concentrated there. there. It's like an octopus system, you know, with the big head and the tentacles everywhere. And then this u everyone is talking about that. Everyone is getting getting some achievements, getting the money for an AI enabled project is much easier than for any other projects and everything is going from down to top as well. and all the initiatives in AI supported. Thank you while we are experimenting as well but I would be bureaucratic and I will say that we have organized a specialized board meeting and we said that in the personal goals of every member of the board there will be two KPIs in AI. First one is the implementation of initiatives and secondly implementing AI in their teams. How many people have gone through AI training and how many tools are used? KPIs is the backbone of everything. Andre, what about Spurbank? Well, it's hard to answer this question to you. I'm going to share this with the audience. I think that Zur has gone through all the stages, through all the options and varants. And I think AI in Zubber I mean Alexander has been an active champion for that. We had very decentralized models across businesses. Everyone in siloed businesses were doing siloed models. Then the models were more centralized. So we're changing the approaches. So we went through various options and we have another evolution stage. Right now the transformation we understood that these solutions becoming more mature. we have a special team that is focusing on fundamental models and here we are talking about the implementation on the market for the retail and corporate customers. I mean there's no organizational model that you should use for every stage you need to reconfigure and assess what level of maturity are you at what problems do you want to solve right now and then to adapt the organizational structure and the model and the KPIs We like the KPIs very much or not really depending on the circumstances.

But what's important is to avoid being changing all the time that you cannot expect everything to go according to your forecast. And another effect that I think we need to take advantage of is we need to lower the threshold for entry as much as possible. The lower it is, the higher the chances are to develop technologies that will be changing our organizations and our products for the benefit of clients and people. Dear participants, dear friends, thank you for this conversation. I still have a lot of questions for you. I think as as all of you do, we meet with the colleagues very very often and we can spend hours and hours debating these things. There are a lot of many there are a lot of interesting issues that we can discuss and it's great that we have this platform of the conference to exchange our opinions. I encourage everyone to join the alliance and if it is impossible for you for for some reason you can participate in thematic discussions which is a much more friendly format. Valeria the CEO of the alliance is here today. she will be happy to help you with all kinds of organizational issues. We gather together as alliance members to discuss the most pressing issues. This great methodology book is the result of all the insights that we've collected that we've garnered from all these productive discussions. Thank you very much and hope to see you back. Your round of applause for Alexander Vidian and Andre B. Thank you very much for the session. We will continue very shortly. While the speakers are leaving the stage, let me remind you that tomorrow we will have day three, the closing day of the conference AI journey 2025. This will be the day dedicated to science. We will hear from AI experts on the latest developments and innovations in AI and three award ceremonies. Today after this short break we will move on to the national awards ceremony for the biggest contributions in AI. We will reconvene at 1810 Moscow time. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.

This is where science, technology, and human capabilities merge together and move forward. We are going to summarize the results of the annual AI leaders award and we will celebrate those who make digital intelligence a constant assistant for each of us. The organizers are the AI alliance and the autonomous nonprofit organization digital economy with the support of the government of the Russian Federation. The laureates and participants of the award are jointly shaping a space where technology serves the interests of our country, expanding the horizons of possibilities and enhancing the potential of every individual. The organizers received over 380 applications in three categories, scientists, regions, and companies. It's encouraging that this number grows every year. Considering that according to the award rules, alliance companies cannot participate in the selection. This year, the award is presented in an updated format. Each category now has its own nominations, which I will talk about later. And now let's explore the amazing present. To open the award ceremony, I invite onto the stage first deputy chairman of the executive board of spare and chairman of the supervisory board of the AI alliance, Alexander Vidin.

Hello. this is the third award thankful to the digital economy, the government of Russia, the administration of the president and you personally and all of the members of the AI alliance for the energy and the effort they've been investing into this award. This is not technology for technologies sake. This is technology for people for each and every human being in the regions in different life situations. This is extremely important and I'm happy to see how this is the result of collaboration between businesses, universities, the government. These are crucial, fascinating solutions that work for the benefit of people. 383 participants is now the new record and it's just the beginning. We've been discussing at length how we should select the winners and also we've been discussing application rules and we have long decided that companies who are members of the alliance should not participate in the competition because first this is a conflict of interest and also it wouldn't be really interesting to see Yandex, ZBA and TBank and Alpha competing among each because they would be at the top of the top inevitably. That's not the right thing to do. We select the initiatives that exist outside of the alliance created based on AI technology and recognized by the entire community. We're looking forward to seeing the winners here. Thank you very much, Mr. Vidahin. Your applause to Mr. Vidahin. We are beginning the ceremony and recognizing the merits of those who pave the way to the future with the power of their scientific inspiration, research drive, and courage in applying cuttingedge technology. The award category for scientists. This category features young researchers under 35. The laurates works and solutions are bridges between theory and practice. Thanks to them, the path to breakthroughs has shortened from several years to several minutes. This year we received 47 applications. The award for scientists category is a public recognition of achievements and financial support for young researchers. And today, three of them will receive an award of 1 million rubles each. It's about time to find out the names of the best. To present the national award AI leaders in the award for scientist category, I invite on the stage director for AI technology development at Yandex and chairman of the jury for the award for scientists, Alexander Kryov.

We had a great jury and it was just a pleasure to discuss their works, their submissions because we know ideas. We've been discussing this We've had heated discussions on who should be the winners because there were so many amazing candidates. To all of those who didn't win, it's such a shame that we only have three winning places. Please make sure you submit your your solutions next year. But that said, I am sure that the winners are definitely the best of the best. Science is very close to production or rather production is adjacent to science. The the range is just half step. There's a research paper and then a few months later you already see it in production. This is a normal situation. So the awards that we are giving out are not just awards for something that might one day become useful. No, we are giving out awards to our researchers and scientists who are right now making contributions to global science and we are already consumers of their solutions. As companies that implement their solutions in their processes and as end users because as individuals we use the results of their science every day. Thank you, Alexander. And now let's hear about the first winner. The first laurate of the award for scientists is Anastasia and Cphereova. Anastasia and Cphrova. Anastasia and Cphrava. [applause] Anastasia's algorithms enhance the robustness of AI systems and her data sets and benchmarks are used by research laboratories worldwide to ensure the quality and safety of future media technologies. Anessia leads a research group conducting studies in computer vision and media algorithms and has already managed to launch several startups. Anastasia, while you were coming up on stage, we saw that you are accompanied by fans. Your personal fan club is in the hall. We are proud of you, it says on the sign. And Cecia, can you tell us more about your fans who supporting you here today? My aunt and uncle are here to support me. They've been supporting me all throughout my my studies and I'm very happy to see them here and I'm very happy to see that my work has been recognized. Thank you very much. Thank you. And if I'm not mistaken, the aunt also has a scientific degree. That's true. So it's already a dynasty. A round of applause. As far as I remember over the past four years, I think Demitra Bolian, the research advisor of Anastasia, was telling me, \"If you try to hunt her, you'll see what I'll do to you. the next winner is the second laurate of the award for scientists is Maxim Rakuba.

Good evening dear friends. I'm very happy to be here on this stage. Russia actively developing AI technology is only growing. Just three years ago, we had 24 regions in this category. It's now 37. We had 40 42 applications and now it's over 100. This is a great pace of progress. And I would also like to underscore the sophistication, the complexity of solutions. So previously it used to be chatbots, computer vision, facial recognition. Now we're talking about consultants and complex systems helping prepare documents, manage regions, a variety of healthcare solutions. The contribution made by the regions is invaluable. Each region is essentially a lab, a unique lab that tries and tests its unique solutions. Working in collaborations with big companies and startups alike and this gives us certain trends which help us which help the country develop actively and adopt AI technology. Taking the opportunity, I would like to say that to all of the regions that information security should be a priority because the technologies are becoming more and more complicated. The documents and data that we entrust the technologies with are becoming more increasingly more confidential. So the security issues have to be factored in your solutions. And otherwise I would like to thank all of the other regions that are actively implementing the technologies. This is helping our country to live forward. A lot of gratitude to all of you and to award winners. Thank you. Thank you very much.
