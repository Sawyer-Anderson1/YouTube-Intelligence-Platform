        "text": " you've been uh documenting the evolution of your uh de workflow over the past few months There's a really good blog post on August with and October with and the recent one December 28th. I recommend everybody go read them They have a lot of different information in them but sprinkled throughout is the evolution of your de workflow. So, I was wondering if you could speak to that I started my my first touch point was cloud code like in April. It was not great but it was good and this whole paradigm shift that suddenly work in the terminal was very refreshing and different Um but I still needed the IDE quite a bit because it's just not good enough And then I experimented a lot with cursory Um, that was good I didn't really like the fact that it was so hard to have multiple versions of it So eventually I I I went back to cloud code as my my main driver and that got better and yeah at some point I had like seven subscriptions like was burning through one per day because I was I got I really comfortable at running multiple windows side by side i all CLI all terminal So like what how much were you using ID at this point i Um very very rarely mostly a riff viewer to actually like I got more and more comfortable that I don't have to read all the code I know I have one blog post where I say I don't read the code But if you read it more closely I mean I don't read the boring parts of code because if you if you look at it most software is really just like data comes in it's moved from one shape to another shape Maybe you store it in a database maybe I get it out again I'll show it to the user The browser does some processing or native happy Some data goes in goes up again and does the same dance in reverse We're just we're just shifting data from one form to another and that's not very exciting Or the whole how is my button aligned in Tailwind. I don't need to read that code Other parts that maybe something that touches the database Um yeah I have to do I have to read and review that code Can you actually there's in one of your blog post uh the just talk to it the no BS way of argentic engineering you have this graphic the curve of argentic programming on the xu axis is time on the axis is complexity uh there's the please fix this where you prompt a short prompt on the left and in the middle there's super complicated eight agents complex orchestration with uh multi-checkouts chaining agents together custom station workflows, library of 18 different slash commands large full stack features You're super organized You're super complicated sophisticated software",

I always tell people I I do argentic engineering and then maybe after 3:00 am I switch to vibe coding and then I have regrets on the next day i Yeah. Well, a walk of shame i You just have to clean up and like fix your We've all been there i So, people start trying out those tools the builder type get really excited and then you have to play with it right It's the same way as you have to play with a guitar before you can make good music It's it's not oh I I touch it once and it just flows off It It's a It's a a skill that you have to learn like any other skills And I see a lot of people that are not as positive mindset towards the techs They try it once It's like you sit me on a piano I played once and it doesn't sound good and I say the piano's That's that's sometimes the impression I get because it does not it needs a different level of thinking You have to learn the language of the agent a little bit understand where they're good and where they need help You have to almost consider consider how Codex or Claude sees your codebase. Like they start a new session and they know nothing about your product project and your project might have hundred thousands of lines of code So you got to help those agents a little bit and keep in mind the limitations that context size is an issue to like guide them a little bit as to where they should look and that often does not require a whole lot of work But it's helpful to think a little bit about their perspective as as weird as it sounds I mean it's not it's not alive or anything right But they always start fresh I have I have the the system understanding So with a few pointers I can immediately say \"Hey, I want to like make a change there You need to consider this this and this And then they will find a look at it and then they'll their view of the project is always is not never",

I don't even care about the implementation I what like in almost all PRs are person has a problem Person tries to solve the problem person sends PR. I mean there's like clean up stuff and other stuff but like 99% is like this way right They either want to fix a fix a bug add a feature usually one of those two And then comics will be like yeah it's quite clear person tried this and this Is this the most optimal way to do it",

Yeah. we could totally do this and this and or this and this and then I consider okay is this worth the reactor or should we like keep that for later Many times I just do the reactor because uh reactors are cheap now even though you might break some other PRs nothing really matters anymore like those modern agents will just figure things out They might just take a minute longer but you have to approach it like a discussion with a a very capable engineer who's generally makes good comes up with good solution Some sometimes needs a little help But also don't force your world view too hard on it Let the agent do the thing that it's good at doing based on what it was trained on So don't like force your world view because it might it might have a better idea because it just knows a better idea better because I was trained on that more That's multiple levels actually I think partially why I find it quite easy to work with agents is because I led engineering teams before you know I had a large company before and eventually you have to understand and accept and realize that your employees will not write the code the same way you do Maybe it's also not as good as you would do but it will push the project forward And if I breathe down everyone's neck they're just going to hate me and they're going to move very slow i Yeah. i So, so some level of acceptance that yes maybe the code will not be as perfect Yes, I would have done it differently i but also yes this is a this is a working solution And in the future if it actually turns out to be too slow or problematic we can always redo it We can always spend more time on it A lot of the people who struggle are those who",

We still have it still it still has a place but I just run tests locally and if they work locally I push domain um a lot of the traditional ways how to approach projects I I wanted to give it a different spin on this project you know there's no there's no develop branch main should always be shippable yes we have when I do releases I I run tests and sometimes I I basically don't commit any other things so so we can we can stabilize um releases but the goal is that main's always shippable and moving fast i So by way of advice would you say that your prompts should be short I used to write really long prompts and by writing",

I mean in some sense shouldn't that be what PRs slowly become Is English? Well, what I really tried with the project is I asked people to give me the prompts and very very few actually cared Even though that is such a wonderful indicator because I see I actually see how much care you put in and it's very interesting because the currently the way how people work and drive the agents is is wildly different i in terms of like the prompt in terms of what what are the actually what are the different interesting ways that people think of agents that you've experienced I think not a lot of people ever considered the way the agent sees the world i So empathy being empathetic towards the agent i in a way empathetic but yeah you you like you at your stupid canker but you don't realize that they start from nothing and you have like a bad agent file that doesn't help them at all and then they exploit your code base which is like a pure mess with like weird naming and then people complain that the agent's not good like you try",

But the building is really practice is really building the actual skills to playing playing and so doing building the skill of what it takes it to work efficiently with LLMs i which is why it would you went through the whole arc of software engineer talk simply and over complicate things there's a whole bunch of people who try to automate the whole thing i I don't think that works maybe a version of that works but that's kind of like in the is when we had the waterfall model of software development I even war related right I started out I I built a very minimal version I played with it I I need to understand how it works how it feels and then it gives me new ideas I could not have planned this out in my head and then put it into some orchestrator and then like something comes out like it's to me it's much more my idea what it will become evolves as I build it and as I play with it and as I I try out stuff So, so people who try to use like things like Gast Town or all",

Like that you feel the love in the great engineering That's so important Humans are incredible at that Great humans great builders are incredible at that and infusing the things they build with that little bit of love Not to be clicked but it's true I mean you mentioned that you initially created the soul MD. It was very fascinating the the whole thing that entropic has a has like a now they call it constitution back then but that was months later like 2 months before people already found that it was almost like the detective game where the agent mentioned something and then they found they managed to get out a little bit of that string of that text but the it was nowhere documented and then you by just by feeding it the same text and asking it to like continue they got more out and then and then you but like a very blurry version and by like hundreds of tries they kind of like narrowed it down to what was most likely the original text I found it fascinating i It was fascinating they were able to pull that out from the weights right i And and also just kudos to entropic Like I think that's it's a really it's a really beautiful idea to like like some of the stuff that's in there like like we hope Cloud finds meaning in his work cut we don't maybe it's a little early but I think that's meaningful that's something that's important for the future as we approach something that at some point me and we not has like glimpses of consciousness whatever that even means because we don't even know",

And then you like rewrote the templates and then whatever came out was good So we already have like i basically AI prompting AI because I didn't write any of those words Uh it was the intent was for me But this is like kind of like my agent's children Uh your uh your soul at is famously still private One of the only things you keep private Uh, what are some things you can speak to that's in there that's part of the",
