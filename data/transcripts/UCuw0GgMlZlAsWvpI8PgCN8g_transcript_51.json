        "text": " [Music] Welcome to Zcast everyone. I'm Zas Caraval from ZK Research and it's global citizen week in New York and I'm here with Esther Kamini founder of Farmer Lifeline Technologies. and you also happen to be this year's Cisco Youth Leadership Award winner. So congratulations on that. And this is I get to do a lot of interviews over the course of the year, probably 200 or so. This is one of my favorite ones because I get to interview people that are innovating with cool technology to actually help the planet be a better place. And so thank you very much for that. So before we get into the prize and what your company does, just a little a little background on yourself. Oh, thank you also for having me. so for me I grew up in a farming community and my family depended on farming purely for our income and it was sad to see the devastating effects of pests and diseases where at least a third of our produce was destroyed in every farming season and that meant our income was affected. Some of my basic needs went unmet and that was every year. Every year. Every year. and not just for my family but also for all members of the community. And then realizing that it was not just a problem in my farming community but also in Kenya and in Africa and even in the global south really. but I got the opportunity to go to the university as the only girl from my village who made it to the university. Well, congratulations on that too. Thank you. And I studied mathematics and computer science. Yeah. So that's a bit about who Esther is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And again, congratulations on the award. That's something Cisco does annually, , to recognize, , , a young entrepreneur who is actively trying to, , make the world a better place. And so, , , talk about the company itself and and what it does. You mentioned obviously the devastating effect pest had on your farm. , so I'm sure it has something to do with that, but go into a little detail on how it works. Sure. Our farmer lifeline technologies exist to get farmers ahead of crop pests and diseases. And how we are doing this, we're using AI enabled cameras that are mounted on farms overlooking the crops. Then the cameras will continuously capture images of the crops on the farm. Then in the event of a pest or a disease, a farmer is notified through a simple SMS on the mobile phone in their local language. Then the SMS will notify them of the crop type, the pest or disease that has been identified and recommendations of what they should apply. Yeah. Now you mentioned in your community it was about a third of the crop that would be lost every year due to pests. Is that is that",

Now you mentioned in your community it was about a third of the crop that would be lost every year due to pests. Is that is that it vary by region? Just talk about the problem itself. Yeah, when you think about it, , in Africa, we losing almost half, it's about 47% of all the food produced is lost to pests and diseases. That is preh harvest. So, a third you were low. At that is actually even low. And it's actually projected that by midentury, we might be losing almost 70% of the food produced if immediate action is not taken. So, when you look at the food being lost every year, it's enough to feed 1.2 billion people. Wow. And we still talk about food insecurity. So interventions that can help reduce that statistic are more than welcome. Yeah. Yeah. And so typically what would a farmer do every year then to ward off pests? Obviously if they're losing that much, they're unaware that there are like when the pests come and the damage they're having until it's too late. Yeah, that's correct. Most farmers actually live with the pest and diseases unidentified or when they do identify them, it's too late. It's almost near harvest and as I said almost half of their produce is destroyed. So what they've been relying on is guesswork or just the naked eye to identify any pest or disease. Then get a hypothesis of what the disease could be or what the pest could be. Go to the nearest agra dealer, get a chemical spray and hope that whatever they've sprayed will actually work. then we have extension officers that are that are outnumbered. We have one extension officer is rationed to about 2,000 farmers. So they are farmers who will never meet an extension officer or even get any of those services. So when you also look at technologies that have come up that small holder farmers can maybe even rely on like drones, they charge $100 per hour to fly over their farms. And $100 could be what that farmer actually is anticipating to get from selling the produce after feeding the family. You see, that's 100 an hour. That's 100 an hour. Yeah. So that's completely unaffordable. Completely. Yeah. Then we have private aronomists that take samples of crops to labs and then come back two 3 weeks later with a diagnosis and they charge $60 per test. A farmer requires about four tests in a crop cycle. So that's about $240 for a crop cycle. Again, expensive and also lacks the the timely detection of the pests and diseases required. Yeah. And and so how did you get the idea to use AI for this? Obviously AI is, you know, a big part of every conference I go to, every discussion I",

Obviously AI is, you know, a big part of every conference I go to, every discussion I it. Yeah, sure. I think mainly it's because of where I'm coming from. I've seen the the problems that we've we've suffered or rather I've seen the the the pain points of small holder farmers growing up. And then what computer science presented to me was a unique opportunity that I hadn't actually thought about. So in computer science I learned a lot about data science. I learned about machine learning and then AI came up. And so I learned that you can actually train a model to see a healthy and infested crop so many times that when that device is placed in a farm, it can tell when a crop is healthy and when it's infested. And then I thought, what do we have around us that gives us 24/7 surveillance? And I thought, we have cameras, but I've never seen a camera on the farm. So the first thing was also to run and get our intellectual property registered in Kenya and we're like bingo we have a camera in the farm 24-hour surveillance notify the farmer on time through their mobile phones and in their local language then charge them only $3 as opposed to the other options that they had that were quite expensive. Yeah. And so one camera can serve how many farms? So one camera has a scanning radius of about 900 m and based on the land fragmentation in Kenya it's able to serve between four to five farmers. but with the support that we received from the Cisco youth leadership award we are investing in research and development to increase that radius to 1,500 m that will serve about nine farmers in one direction then integrate outer rotation. So that could be almost 30 farmers per device from one camera. From one camera. And how high do you mount it? So it will depend on what they've planted. Yeah. then we'll also look at the logistics of how it's rotating depending on how they've planted. So that will go into our piloting phase. Yeah. Yeah. And this also has a a direct impact on on women as well. I think I read in the bio or the story of it says in your area women carry much of the burden of work but don't have access to the same technology as the men. Can you talk about that? Yeah, it's quite sad that only about 10% of women in these rural communities have access to extension services leave alone a smartphone. And women carry the weight of both farming and family because they they provide almost 50% actually more than 50% of the labor force in these rural farming",

And women carry the weight of both farming and family because they they provide almost 50% actually more than 50% of the labor force in these rural farming a technology that would include them, you know, and serve them so that when they're still working in their homes, they can get a notification. They don't have to be in the farm to detect the pest and disease with their naked eye. An SMS is enough for them to take action and save their crops while they steal time. Yeah. And and well, that's amazing then that they can I would I would I would suspect without your solution, you mentioned it's a lot of guess work, but you actually have to be in the farm inspecting it all the time. Yes. And do the guest work while on the farm. Yeah. Yeah. So now they could be at home taking care of the kids. That's a nice story. Yeah. And you were telling me also that the you you built your own models for this, correct? we had to look for the right team for the job. with my background in computer science, I was able to identify talent, young talent. I must admit it's not easy because hiring a software developer is quite expensive and at the beginning I had to rely also on personal savings that I had to pay them sometimes not even paying myself. Of course I could never tell them that that they actually earned more than the CEO. but they got the job done and they got the job done well. It did take time because training the models does take time. You have to identify good and bad data. You have to identify what is making the accuracy low and what can we do to make it high. Which classes of plans have higher accuracy than which ones? Then work on the lower ones to increase the accuracy. So it has taken time. Yeah. To train those models. Yeah. And you've been working on this you said five years I think. Five years from 2020. Yeah. And and so where are you in the journey now? Is it are there still certain crops it works better for? Is it pretty universal? what you know, how do you think about your addressable market now and what what you do well and what you don't? That's a good question because it points us to whether we're ready for scale or not. we made a step further to integrate the the system with a global database API and that helps us identify pests and diseases on thousands of species of crops. So whether it's mounted in America, in New York in an apple farm or in the Philippines or in Kenya in South Africa, a device in Kenya, in South Africa, Philippines, New",

So whether it's mounted in America, in New York in an apple farm or in the Philippines or in Kenya in South Africa, a device in Kenya, in South Africa, Philippines, New the global database API and we making tremendous steps towards our IP. We've filed for an African one and are pursuing a global patent as well. So that even as we scale, we also protect ourselves intellectually. Yeah. And what countries do you operate in now? We are in Kenya. Okay. right now with the support that we received from Cisco, we are looking to spread wings to at least the East African region. because the African patent also includes most of the East African countries around us. Yeah. And I didn't actually realize there was a global database for for pests and farming, but I guess that makes sense that there there would be. And so as I mentioned, you did win the award. and I I do know the process. It's pretty rigorous and there are thousands of entries every year. Yeah. What did what did winning the award mean to you? I mean it's it's mind-blowing. I mean Cisco, can we begin there? It's Cisco. I I read about Cisco while in school, about internet, about routers that they use for the internet. It had never crossed my mind that I would be a recipient of an award by Cisco. So, this is just mind-blowing. And for us as a tech company, even just seeing Cisco on our portfolio just means a lot to us. and winning this award before getting to 30 years. I'm actually 29. Yeah, 29 years. I heard about them when I was 27 years old. And my first thought was no, you know that there should be guys who know more tech than I do, who are doing greater stuff than I do that deserve the award. but when I met the global citizen team and they got to know what I was doing through the wisest global citizen award, they're like, \"Give it a shot. Give it a shot.\" I was like, \"Okay, why not?\" it wouldn't hurt. So, we put in the work, did the application, and did our interviews and to even get the news that we we won, it it just baffled us. We were left speechless. Yeah. Well, no, good for you. In fact, of all the award winners I've interviewed, I believe you're the first one that's actually had AI as a core part of the solution. And I guess maybe that's just the the times. And I suspect moving forward it'll be a bigger part of it. And and so you now you are working with the Cisco team and talk about that. How are you working with the team to try and make your product more scalable, more you know more broadly applicable?",

How are you working with the team to try and make your product more scalable, more you know more broadly applicable? in the research and development part of the innovation and we want to increase that radius to 1,500 and that also means that it actually the support has enabled us to train our own models and not rely on any pre-trained ones. but we've noticed that we have a challenge with the PCs that we're using and we are really looking forward to working with Cisco and partnering to see how efficient the process can be when using the Cisco devices or systems. I know I can get a lot of mentorship from the tech team here at Cisco. So that's something we're really looking forward to. Yeah. Well, that's great. And you already talked about what you're going to use the money for, but to to clarify, it's to scale the product, reach more farmers in more countries. Ultimately, your goal is is what? To have this product available where? Yeah. we have a target of 1 million small holder farmers by 2030. Looks huge, but we have the right team. We have the right mission, the vision is there, the tech is there, it's proven, and we have the right partners like Cisco and Global Citizen on board. So we know that the the goal is within reach and we'll get through the 1 million. Yeah. Now 1 million you were telling me when we were prepping for this that in the areas you want to serve there's 500 million. Yes. Yeah. in Kenya we have 7 million small holder farmers. In Africa we have roughly 33 million small holder farmers. And in the global south we have about 550 million small holder farmers. Okay. That's a drop in the ocean. 1 million is a drop in the ocean. Yeah. But one So 1 million though if your solution could eliminate the pest wastage. How much food extra food would that create? When look at it right now that the 47% is enough to feed 1.2 billion people. If we eradicate the 47% that is being lost in Africa, it means an additional 1.2 billion people will be wellfed a whole year. Yeah. That well and I think everybody's well aware of the global food shortage that we've been having that we have today. So, it's it's a fascinating thing because we as a society, we talk about different ways of growing food and different types of food sources, but if we could just save the food we're already growing from pests, that alone would have a huge impact on closing the food supply problem. That's correct. Yeah. Because they're putting in the work. The farmers are putting in the work and with the right support, they can",

You know, we look at agriculture and it's contribution even to our GDP even as Kenya is just amazing and it has the potential to even absorb more youth even from the unemployment category. So, it's an untapped resource that people should open their eyes to. Yeah. Well, certainly. And if people want to learn more about your company, what's your website? www.farmmerlifeeline.co.k. Okay. And you know I think Yuri and I think the one commonality I've seen from all the award winners is it was a person with an idea that was brave enough to move forward with it. And it does show one person can actually change the lives of millions of people. And so for young entrepreneurs out there that maybe have a good idea, what's a little bit of advice you can give them? Wow, that's a that's a good parting shot. Well, you're a great role model. Thank you so much. but I have to also say that when people with these ideas meet the right people and these people are intentional about supporting young people then we can make it happen and to these young people who who have this problem-solving minds let's not be afraid to step out there it starts as an idea but you need to make the first move it will be bold some of us who are called crazy we get hot slaps on our entrepreneurship journey we don't pay ourselves a trust. People earn more than we do. But at the end of the day, the impact that we make will fuel us to continue doing what we do. And there's support for you. Just make that step. Yeah. Now, you'll be on stage at the Global Citizen Concert telling your story. You nervous about that? Yes. 60,000 people. I think it's more than 60,000, isn't it? Oh my god. And and online. Yes. Well, millions will find it following online. Yeah. I know. That's the largest audience I've ever spoken to. So, yeah. Yeah. Well, you'll be up there I think right before Cardi B or Shakira. Yeah. So, you're in good company. I'll be famous. Yeah. All right. Is there anything else you want to add? Yeah. I'm really grateful to what Cisco is doing and global citizen even for having such an award. It's it's really good to see that we the young people are getting the support that we need. we mentioned that patient capital is something that is really crucial when we are growing our businesses and why it's crucial it's because patient capital gives us time to invest in research and development as I",

Yeah. Well, I think it's Cisco that should be proud to have you represent their brand as their youth leadership award winner. It's a it's an amazing award, but I think in it's, you know, it's certainly welld deserved and like I said, the commonality I've seen over the years is just the the willingness to want to drive change and that's not always easy. So, you know, congratulations. Thank you so much. Thank you for having me. No, thank you very much for telling your story.
