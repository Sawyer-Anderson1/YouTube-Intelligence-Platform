We know that a faster model is a smarter model because it can get more thoughts done in the same amount of time. We also want to support the entire industry. NVIDIA has a unique way of working with all companies. native AI companies, companies that are just starting to use AI, big companies, small companies, companies all around the world, partner with NVIDIA because they know that we're going to support them as they solve their own problems. We're able to do this because Neotron is open, because we're providing all of these different technologies in a way that lets different organizations decide what parts of it are most useful to them, and then they can decide how best to build and deploy AI for their own needs.",
