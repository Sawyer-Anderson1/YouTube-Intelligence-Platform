[music] We've [music] been partners with OpenAI for about a year. , we're mainly working currently with the SHA GPT rolling that out across the enterprise. but we're also exploring the use of APIs. [music] We put quite a lot of licenses available in the organization and we stimulate experimentation as much as [music] possible. [music] when we did the introduction then everyone was only allowed to join if they joined us the whole team so that it's not dependent on one smart guy building a GPT for his his team and then moving on and no one understood what he did rather we wanted to get sort of yeah into the team DNA so we are very much organization which decentralizes decision-m very much lower in the organization and that's that's I think a strength right now when we work with [music] open AI with chat GPT to allow the organization to experiment to test and there's also a lot of u pull in the organization to really get it the pace of the requests [music] that we are getting is just expanding and getting [music] higher and higher speed of adoption speed of getting results I mean you expect results but it's it's going faster. It's going faster in time. It's going faster in in the quality.",
