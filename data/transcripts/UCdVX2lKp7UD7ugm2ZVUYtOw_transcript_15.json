        "text": " Boardwalk bar, soft neon and salt on skin, You draw a line through midnight sand\u2014the sea lights from within. Pixel sparks in every wave, the shoreline starts to glow, We whisper prompts to the moon and watch the answers flow. Your hand in mine, we sync to the ocean\u2019s time, Fine-tuning names in light until our patterns rhyme. When the neural tide rolls in, we\u2019re writing in the foam, Footsteps turn to blue-fire script that spells out \u201cbring me home.\u201d Say the word, the sea replies in luminous design\u2014 Surf the bioluminescent night, be my signal in the brine. When the neural tide rolls in, it teaches us to glide\u2014 You\u2019re the model, I\u2019m the wave, riding on your side. Cabana chairs and lantern glow, a pastel bungalow, Dreamwave vinyl in the breeze, slow ceiling fan on low. Rooftop pool above the pier, reflections like a grid, We count the crests like epochs till the doubts forget we lived. Heartbeat clicks, a metronome of hush and shine, Loss falls low\u2014our futures fit and fine. When the neural tide rolls in, we\u2019re writing in the foam, Footsteps turn to blue-fire script that spells out \u201cbring me home.\u201d Say the word, the sea replies in luminous design\u2014 Surf the bioluminescent night, be my signal in the brine. Zeros drift to ones along the pier\u2019s long spine, Palms keep time like clocks while constellations align. We don\u2019t chase forever\u2014we infer it from the signs, A gentle gradient descent to where your shoulder finds mine. Oh-oh, blue fire, carry us wide\u2014 Neural tide, neural tide. Bonfire hush behind the dunes, a warm and steady guide, The ocean saves our latest draft\u2014then pulls us out to ride.",
