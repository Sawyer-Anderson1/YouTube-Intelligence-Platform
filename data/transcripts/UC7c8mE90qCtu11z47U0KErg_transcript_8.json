Let's say you got AI to write a post for you and you gave it [music] some feedback which is very specific to that post which is not relevant for everything else.

[music] Basically, it has a DK effect. The longer the thread becomes, the worse the post will become. Interesting. But there is one way to hack this [music] is that every time you have a new conversation with it, go back to the first conversation, you click on edit and drop that research [music] again. So that for AI, every conversation is a brand new conversation. You're not breaking the context.",
