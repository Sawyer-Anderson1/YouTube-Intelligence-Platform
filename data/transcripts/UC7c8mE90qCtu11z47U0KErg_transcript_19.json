        "text": " A Reddit user recently shared that he went to the emergency room. Reason and unbearable abdominal pain. Doctors examined him, found nothing, but his pain was unbearable. He opened Grock, typed his symptoms, and within minutes it flagged atypical appendicitis or a perforated ulcer. The AI noticed something critical. No fever, soft abdomen. These aren't normal appendicitis symptoms. But Brock wasn't fooled. It told him, \"Go back. Demand a CT scan now.\" He couldn't tell doctors and AI sent him. So he lied. Said his nurse sister recommended the scan. The result, a severely inflamed appendix. Emergency surgery, full recovery. AI isn't here to replace doctors. It's here to catch what humans miss.",
