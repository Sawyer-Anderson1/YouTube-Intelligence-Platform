The gap between those three square miles and the rest of the world is getting wider and wider at an incredible rate. And I have always the same observations that Ahmad has. There's amazing talent all over Europe and all over the world. And shouldn't this proliferate out to all that talent? But when I observe, you know, that Peter, that meeting we had with Richard Socher, I heard you go, \"Holy shit.\" Like 12 times during that meeting. Yeah. But the gap between what's going on in those three square miles of the earth and the rest of the world is mind-blowingly big and accelerating very, very quickly. So I think, you know, building data centers around Europe is is way too little, way too late, unless it's done with some other in combination with with some other force that I don't know about yet. But just observing it that that gap is accelerating very quickly.",
