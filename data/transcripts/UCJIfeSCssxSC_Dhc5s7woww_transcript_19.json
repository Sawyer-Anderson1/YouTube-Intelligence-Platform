        "text": " Uh you think uh on the hardware side we mentioned Nvidia a bunch of times Do you think Jensen and Nvidia are going to keep winning I think they have the downside that they have to iterate a lot and uh manufacture a lot and I think they probably what what they're doing they do innovate but um I think there's always the chance that there is something who does something fundamentally different who gets very lucky and then does something but the problem is I think adoption you know like the the mode of Nvidia is probably not just the GPU it's more like the CUDA ecosystem and that has evolved over so many two decades I think I mean even back when I was a grad student we I was in a lab we did biophysical simulations molecular dynamics and we had a Tesla GPU back then just for the computations it was I mean 15 years ago now and it just they built this up for a long time and that's like that's the mode I think it's not the the chip itself although they have now the money to iterate and build and scale but then it's really um the compatibility it's like well if you're at that scale as a company why would you go with something risky where it's only i a few chips that they can make per years you go with a big one But then i I do think with LLMs now also it will be easier to design something like CUDA you know like the next so it took 15 years because it's hard but then now we have LLMs we can maybe replicate CUDA i and I wonder if there will be a separation of the training and the inference compute i as we kind of stabilize a bit more and more and more uh compute is needed for inference Mhm. i That's supposed to be the point of the Croc acquisition and and that's why part of what Vera Rubin is where they have a new chip with no high bandwidth memory which is one of or very little which is one of the most expensive pieces It's designed for refill which is the part of inference where you essentially do a lot of matrix multiplications and then you only need the memory when you're doing this auto regressive generation and you have the KV cache swaps So they have this new GPU that's designed for that specific use case and then the cost of ownership per per flop or whatever is actually way lower But I I think that Nvidia's fate lies in the diffusion of AI still their biggest clients are still these hyper scale companies whether it's like Google obviously can make TPUs Amazon is making uranium Microsoft will try to do its own things and like so long as the pace of AI progress is high Nvidia's platform is the most",

So long as that is how it operates I'm pretty optimistic for their situation because it's like it is their top order problem and I don't know if making these chips for the whole ecosystem is the top goal of all these other companies They will do a good job but it might not be as good of a job Since you mentioned Jensen, I've been um reading a lot about history and about singular figures in history What do you guys think about the single man woman view of history how important are individuals for steering the direction of history in the teach sector So you know what's Nvidia without Jensen? You mentioned Steve Jobs. What's Apple without Steve Jobs? What's XAI without Elon or Deep Mind without Demis? people make things earlier and faster where scientifically many great scientists credit to being in the right place at the right time and still making the innovation where eventually someone else will still have the idea So I think that in that way Jensen is helping manifest this GPU revolution much faster and much more focused than without having a person there it would do And this is making the whole AI build out faster But I do still think that eventually like something like chat would have happened and a buildup like this would have happened but it probably would not have been as fast or like as like I think that's the sort of flavor that is applied People these individual people are people who are placing bets on something Some get lucky some don't But if you don't have these people at the helm it will be more diffused It's almost like investing in a ETF versus individual stocks individual stocks might go up might go down more heavily than an ETF which is more balanced It will eventually go up over time We'll get there But it's just like you know",

Yeah. 20 years i or like another AI win like a deep learning winter could have come i if GPUs weren't around that could change history completely because you could think of all the other technologies that that could have come in the meantime and the focus of human civilization could the Silicon Valley would be captured by different hype but I do think it is uh I mean there's certainly an aspect where it was all planned the GPU trajectory but on the other hand it's also a lot of lucky coincidences for example or good intuition like the investment into this let's say biophysical simulations or like I mean I think it started with video games and and it just happened to be good at linear algebra because video games require a lot of linear algebra and then you have the biophysical um simulations and then but still I don't think the plan the master plan was AI I think there was just it happened to be Alex Kresevki so someone took these GPUs and like hey let's try to train a near network on that and happened to work really well and I think it only happened because you could purchase those GPUs i gaming would have created a demand for faster processors if Nvidia had gone out of business in the early days i Mhm. i That's what I would think Like I think that the GPUs would have been different for the Alex, but I think like GPUs would still exist at the time of Alex Net and at the time of the Transformer. i It was just hard to know if it would be i one company as successful or multiple smaller companies with worse i chips But I don't think that's like a 100redyear delay It might be a decade delay Well, it could be one two three four five decade delay I mean I just can't see Intel or AMD doing what Nvidia. i I don't think it would be a company that exists I think it would be a different company would ride i like Silicon Graphics or something i So, yeah some company that has died would have done it i But it does like just look looking at it it seems like these singular figures these leaders have a huge impact on the trajectory of the world obviously incredible teams behind them",
