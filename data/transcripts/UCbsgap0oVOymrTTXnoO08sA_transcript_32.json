        "text": " [Music] In a viral clip that's now everywhere a humanoid robot was seen walking the streets of China right next to police officers This wasn't a demo or a teach event It was real streets and real law enforcement In Shenzhen, people watched as a robot called the T800 moved through a busy public area alongside special police units And what made the video unsettling was how ordinary the whole situation looked as if this kind of patrol was already normal The robot comes from engine AI and the name T800 suddenly carries real weight Walking alongside police officers it moved comfortably within the formation matching their pace and presence Its body language felt practiced almost trained with movements that looked intentional rather than experimental The difference was obvious This robot looked ready Now, the footage landed harder because it followed another video Engine AI released just weeks earlier In that clip the company's CEO, Sao Tongyang, stood in front of the T800 wearing protective gear The robot delivered a direct kick to his stomach sending him to the ground The moment played lightly on the surface yet the underlying message was clear This machine can apply real physical force and the company openly chose to show that capability That decision came after earlier videos of the robot performing kicks and combat style movements sparked online debate Some viewers questioned whether the footage was computerenerated. Engine AI responded by removing any remaining doubt The robot interacted physically with a real person on camera in a way that left no room for interpretation Even within a controlled setup the takeaway was unmistakable Humanoid robots are now being presented as systems capable of harming humans when instructed This marks a turning point in how robots are framed For a long time robots were introduced as helpful tools designed to assist people while remaining physically restrained Industrial machines stayed behind safety barriers and service robots moved carefully through human spaces The T800 shifts that narrative It represents a category where physical intervention is part of the intended function rather than an edge case Supporters see clear advantages in this direction Real world examples already exist where robots have reduced risk for officers and civilians In LEC, Texas, police used a bomb squad robot during a prolonged motel standoff with an armed suspect The robot advanced toward the threat deployed tear gas and eventually pinned the suspect allowing officers to move in safely even though that machine was slow wheeled and obviously mechanical It changed how the situation unfolded A humanoid system introduces an entirely different scale of capability One designed to operate in spaces built for humans can move through stairwells hallways doorways and crowds with ease It can restrain individuals apply force when required and function in environments where traditional robots struggle and that changes how law enforcement scenarios can be handled from the ground up Engine AI has spoken openly about where this leads The company recently raised more than $180",

Those plans focus on real environments unpredictable situations and continuous interaction with the public The question of whether humanoid robots can move naturally or generate power already has an answer What matters now is how quickly people grow accustomed to machines that can physically intervene in human behavior Each step forward will be framed around efficiency safety and cost And each individual deployment will appear reasonable on its own The most unsettling part lies in how quietly this transition happens There are no dramatic announcements or warnings The future arrives calmly walks beside authority and waits to be accepted Quick side note before we continue Today's video is sponsored by GenSpark, and it actually lines up well with what's happening across the AI space right now A lot of the focus has shifted away from single models and towards systems that can combine multiple tools and finish real work endtoend. GenSpark positions itself as an all-in-one AI workspace rather than another chat interface Instead of jumping between chat GPT, design tools spreadsheets slide software and automation apply it pulls multiple top models into one environment and actually executes tasks Slides, documents sheets basic websites brand assets even things like automated calls and into handling all sit in one place The idea is simple Fewer tools less switching more finished output One important detail to mention is how they handle model access Inside GenSpark, you're not locked into one system It routes work across different leading models depending on the task And for AI chat and image generation they're offering unlimited usage throughout next year under a single subscription For people juggling multiple AI tools already that consolidation alone is the main appeal You can start right away with the link in the description below They're also running a new year campaign right now From January st to January the you can get 40% off any annual plan That's about $100 off the plus annual or $1,000 off the pro annual All right now let's get back to the video Now, another viral video pushed this whole conversation even further And the robot in the clip is the G1 built by Unitry. An engineer stands in front of it wearing a motion capture suit the kind used to train humanoids by copying human movement in real time Whatever the human does the robot does instantly So, the operator starts showing martial arts movements He lifts his leg into a kick The robot mirrors it perfectly Since they're facing the same way the movement turns on him His own leg swings up and hits him sending him to the floor While the robot keeps",

In November, Unitri also showed a wheeled version called the G1D aimed at data collection and real world testing in industrial service and retail environments Now just few days ago at Techfest 2025 held at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, the same robot stepped onto the main stage and delivered a live dance performance in front of a packed crowd Techfest attracts students researchers families and technologists from across Asia. And it usually focuses on research demos and engineering showcases This time the moment that grabbed everyone's attention came from a robot dancing to the viral track Fine Law. also known as Sherry Balo. Phones came out almost instantly as the robot moved in sync with the music under full stage lighting and sounds The G1 stands just over 4 feet tall and weighs around 77 lbj Built with an articulated frame that lets its arms legs and torso move together smoothly Electric actuators and mealtime control keep it stable while depth cameras and LAR help it adjust its posture as it moves that showed during the performance where the robot stayed in rhythm moved cleanly through the choreography and kept its balance under stage lights loud music and a live crowd This appearance wasn't",

According to Ajabot CEO Lee Yien, the platform has boarded around 600 service providers and more than 1,000 robots so far The company plans to expand quickly with a goal of operating in more than 200 cities during 2026. Behind the scenes Agabot is trying to organize a market that has been chaotic Analysts point out that robot rentals in China have suffered from unstable pricing seasonal demand swings and incompatible systems between different brands Chian Rent aims to standardize that process by acting as a central platform that connects robot makers rental providers and customers The idea of renting robots took off earlier this year after humanoid robots from Unitry appeared at the Chinese New Year Gala, which briefly pushed rental prices sharply higher Since then competition has increased and more robots have entered mass production bringing prices back down The Chinese robot rental market was valued at over",
