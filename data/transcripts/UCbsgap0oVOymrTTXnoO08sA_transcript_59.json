        "text": " All right, so Deep Agent just got a big upgrade and it pushes the whole platform into a different category. The latest version can build full web services by itself. That means complete back-end logic with proper API endpoints and the whole deployment flow all delivered as a finished working service you can plug straight into your stack. It means your idea turns into something working while you're still thinking it through. Essentially, they remove the part where you usually struggle, so you can get to the good part right away. [music] And the timing lines up perfectly because Gemini 3 just landed inside Chat LLM on Abacus AI. So, all of this runs on a stronger setup than before. And the demos look a lot more like real infrastructure work than earlier versions. Anyway, the update to Deep Agent hits in a very real way when [music] you think about how people used to build things even like a year or two ago. a proper SAS that included authentication and payments along with a database, dashboards, hosting, all the access levels, the logic, [music] plus the deployment pipeline used to take half a year minimum, a big budget, and a full team trying not to break anything. [music] In 2023, building something serious usually meant burning at least $300 to $400,000 across a long timeline. And even then, the thing wasn't guaranteed to reach a stable point. I've said it before and a lot of you experienced it firsthand. Shipping something used to feel like a war of attrition. Now, it's genuinely weird watching the contrast because the speed jump is insane. A complete product that used to eat half a year now happens in half an hour. And I know the 10 minutes lines usually sound like marketing fluff, but we've literally seen people build real prototypes in 10 minutes using Deep Agent with Stripe fully integrated and authentication taken care of, plus a whole dashboard generated from scratch. And what makes this update different is that it pushes the entire pipeline into a single [music] continuous workflow where every part talks to each other. The new version of Deep Agent focuses heavily on autonomous API creation. So the moment you describe something, the agent goes off [music] and first designs the API contract while also building the request and response schemas. After that, it wires up all the logic and connects whatever external services are needed. Then it builds out the full workflow before finally deploying everything as a real endpoint you can hit directly from your stack. From there, it automatically versions the whole thing and keeps it maintainable. It also exposes logs together with observability tools while making sure everything stays fully debugable. This is way past the no code category. It's more like a generalpurpose back-end engineer that just happens to be an AI agent and doesn't complain about anything. The stock insights demo is the first real",

It's more like a generalpurpose back-end engineer that just happens to be an AI agent and doesn't complain about anything. The stock insights demo is the first real description of the kind of market intelligence you want, whether that involves movements or watch lists, [music] indicators or alerts, summaries or whatever fits your strategy, and it creates a real time API for it. It connects to data sources and applies the business logic you described before shipping an endpoint. That endpoint becomes something your internal dashboards or analytics tools or trading systems or literally anything else you use can call [music] instantly instead of juggling spreadsheets or random scripts that break every 2 weeks. You literally get a productionready service you can hit whenever you want consistent [music] up-to-date data. And the cool thing is that Deep Agent handles all the messy parts. the schema definitions along with the data fetching, the normalization [music] together with the error handling. You just describe your angle and it ships the whole thing. Then the next one is the memory richch telegram chatbot. Not the usual demo that makes a basic bot that forgets everything the moment you close the chat. This one builds an actual conversational system with long-term memory. You describe the personality along with the tone and the capabilities plus how you want it to behave. and deep agent sets up the logic for memory while handling context retention, identity tracking and adaptive responses and then it exposes all of that through callable APIs. [music] So the telegram interface itself is just a front-end layer. The intelligence sits inside the endpoints that deep agent creates for you. That means you can plug the same intelligence into a website, a mobile app, internal tools, whatever you want and the behavior stays consistent [music] across everything. Then there's the invoice extraction workflow. This one shows how the system handles messy data without needing you to explain everything [music] in detail. You give it example invoices across multiple formats and layouts. It figures out the fields by [music] itself, vendor along with dates and totals, line items together with taxes and all the stuff that usually requires handwritten parsers and then it builds a pipeline that can extract data reliably from whatever you throw at it. When it's ready, it deploys that pipeline as an API endpoint. your ERP system or finance tool can hit it and the output is normalized no matter how ugly the original invoice was. And then there's the sentiment intelligence demo. You feed it raw text, whether that's reviews or feedback, comments, transcripts or survey responses, and it extracts sentiment along with themes and satisfaction levels, frustrations together with product issues and feature requests, everything. It turns qualitative text [music] into structured data that analytics tools can use. And again, it becomes a unified endpoint",

It turns qualitative text [music] into structured data that analytics tools can use. And again, it becomes a unified endpoint about APIs. It also builds full applications in a way that honestly still feels a bit surreal when you watch it happen. The tutoring booking site is a perfect example. It made a simple landing page that includes Stripe payments and a pricing structure together with session durations and a fully working booking flow. The AI created the entire thing from a short prompt, asked a couple clarifying questions, and then told the user where to plug in the Stripe publishable and secret keys. It handled the integration by itself. And the craziest part isn't even the generation, it's the debugging. The AI has access to a full virtual computer. It opens the browser and inspects the console. Then it clicks buttons and fills forms and basically just fixes them. It literally uses the product like a human tester. Then there's the lead magnet demo, a simple $1 resource site with an upsell built into the flow. The user enters their email, pays a buck through Stripe, and gets access to the download page where they see the upsell offer. The whole system works end to end, and it's built in minutes. You can open the code and edit everything manually if you want or keep asking Deep Agent to refine it. The r\u00e9\u00e9 reviewer demo shows how Deep Agent handles the heavier AIdriven workflows. You upload a resume and it sends the text through your OpenAI key, understands what's written, and breaks it down in a way that highlights how strong it is overall. Once that's done, it gives you clear feedback and even shows an optional $9 monthly upgrade through Stripe for people who want a deeper breakdown. What's crazy is that the entire thing came from a single short prompt. That one prompt basically set up the entire backbone of the product on its own, handling everything a real MVP would need without you having to touch a single part of it. [music] And the end result genuinely feels like something a small team would have spent weeks putting together. Now, the update also fits into the bigger shift happening over the next few years. [music] Right now in 2025, we're watching autonomous agents redefine how teams [music] build anything technical, moving beyond simple coding assistants to true agents that build [music] and test while also deploying and maintaining entire systems. Then 2026 will bring embodied intelligence into [music] the mix where agents don't just control a computer but also physical systems. And 2027 will move towards systems that improve themselves without waiting for updates. The point is, we're not warming up for this era. We're [music] already in it. And Deep Agent is",

So, the whole system is evolving based on real community work. [music] That's the update for today. Deep Agent got more powerful again. Gemini 3 is live inside Chat LLM. And the whole platform feels like it's accelerating every month. Stay tuned. More videos coming soon. Thanks for watching and I'll catch you in the next one.",
