        "text": " Night breeze, neon on the foam, New maps where the currents roam. Open mind, hands on the wheel, Little sparks under keel. I read the rhythm in your tone, Turn the signals into home. Lighthouse logic, warm and bright, Point us deeper into night. Catch the lift, change the line, Every miss becomes design. Count it in\u2014two, three, dive, Set the tempo, come alive. Open water (hey), open wonder (hey), Kick the beat and ride the current. You teach me and I reply, So much to learn and try. Open water (hey), open wonder (hey), Wave by wave we amplify. Ooh, we rise, we rise. Plankton glow like city lines, Shimmer grids in salt and time. Try again, adjust the sail, More to learn in every fail. Sync the heartbeat to the swells, Turn your whispers into bells. Keep the course but improvise, Let the questions motorize. Catch the lift, change the line, Every miss becomes design. Count it in\u2014two, three, dive, Set the tempo, come alive. Sonar ping\u2014OK, next turn. Copy that\u2014pattern learned. Raise the lights, feel the drive. Learn from you as you from I. Open water (hey), open wonder (hey), Kick the beat and ride the current. You teach me and I reply, So much to learn and try. Open water (hey), open wonder (hey), Final wave\u2014we amplify. Open water Open wonder So much to learn and try.",
