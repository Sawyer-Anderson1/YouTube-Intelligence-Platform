        "text": " Let's build a personal assistant. I want it to help me with my calendar, emails, to-do lists, and even keep an eye on my home. I use Brev to turn my DGX Spark into a personal cloud. So, I can use the same interface whether I'm using a cloud GPU or a DGX Spark. I use a Frontier model API to easily get started. I wanted to help me with my emails, so I create an email tool for my agent to call. I want my emails to stay private, so I'll add an open model that's running locally on the Spark. Now, for any job, I want [music] the agent to use the right model for the right task. So, I'll use an intentbased model router. This way, [music] prompts that need email will stay on my Spark, and everything else can call the Frontier model. I want my assistant to interact with [music] my world, so I'll hook it up to Hugging Faces Reachi Mini Robot. My agent controls the head, ears, and camera of the Reachi with tool calls. I want to give Richi a voice, and I really like 11 Labs, so I'll hook up their API. Hi, I'm Richi running on DGx Spark. Hey Richi, what's on my to-do list today? your to-do list today. Grab groceries, eggs, milk, butter, and send Jensen the new script. Okay, let's send Jensen that update. Tell him we'll have it for him by the end of day. We'll do. Richi, there's a sketch, too. Can you turn it into an architectural rendering? Sure. Nice. Now make a video and show me around the room. Here you go. That's great. With Brev, I can share access to my Spark and Reachi. So, I'm going to share it with Anna. Hey Richi, what's Potato up to? He's on the couch. I remember you don't like this. I'll tell him to get off. Potato, off the couch. With all the progress in open source, it's incredible to see what you can build. I'd love to see what you create. [snorts]",
