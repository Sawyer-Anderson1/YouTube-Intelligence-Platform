And just in time, as the world builds factories of every kind for chips, computers, life-saving drugs, and AI, as the global labor shortage worsens, we need automation powered by physical [music] AI and robotics more than ever. This where AI meets the world's largest physical industries is the foundation of NVIDIA and Seaman's partnership. For nearly [music] two centuries, Seammens has built the world's industries and now [music] it is reinventing it for the age of AI. Semens is integrating NVIDIA CUDA X libraries, AI models, and Omniverse into its portfolio of EDA, CAE, and digital twin tools and platforms. Together, we're bringing [music] physical AI to the full industrial life cycle. From design and simulation to production and operations, we stand at the [music] beginning of a new industrial revolution, the age of physical AI built by Nvidia and Seammens for the next age of industries.",
