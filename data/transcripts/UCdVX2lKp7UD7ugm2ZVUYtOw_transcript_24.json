        "text": " After hours, code is humming low, Little tiger walks across the keys in slow. Every keystroke maps a hidden lane, Whiskers test the edges of the training rain. Thread by thread, we pull the yarn of light, Knots become a signal in the night. Curiosity engine, purr it into gear, Nine lives of questions drawing answers near. Self-attention glowing, eyes reflect the moon, Chasing little red truths across the room. Backprop quiet as her velvet paws, Tiptoe over errors, smooth the claws. From box into boxes, latent worlds unfold, She fits where she sits in a story we decode. Noise to note, we learn the way it sings, Patterns land as softly as her breathing brings. Curiosity engine, purr it into gear, Nine lives of questions drawing answers near. Self-attention glowing, eyes reflect the moon, Chasing little red truths across the room. In the loop with a gentle purr, Dropout drifts and we still infer. Nine times falling, ten we rise, Green cursors flicker in her eyes. Meow-bit, byte-beat, midnight lab, Tail-flick click track, data tab. Curiosity engine, keep the candle warm, When the world is tangled, you purr it into form. Self-attention glowing, world becomes a room, With a soft-paw cadence, we\u2019re finding how to bloom. Little comet on the windowsill\u2014 Hold the gaze; the noise goes still.",
