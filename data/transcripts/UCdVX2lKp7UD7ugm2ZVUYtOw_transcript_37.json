We rise on wings of code, Over the grids below; You chart the stars I don\u2019t yet know. Glide through the open blue, I lean into you\u2014 Co-pilot of the sky and soul, Learning how to let go. Learning how to let go. Crosswinds of noise try pulling me wide; You hold the heading, I hold the glide. Altimeter steady, attitude true, I trim the fear\u2014you trim me too.
