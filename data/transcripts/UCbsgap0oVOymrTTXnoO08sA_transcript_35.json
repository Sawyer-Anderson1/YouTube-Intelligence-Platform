They've scheduled a dedicated Hyundai media day on January eth in Las Vegas running from 1 to 1:45 pump Pacific time According to Hyundai, this presentation will focus on human robot collaboration manufacturing innovation and how robotics fits into the group's broader production and logistics systems Hyundai has said this strategy ties directly into its music group value network and its softwaredefined factory approach That includes how robots are developed trained deployed updated and managed across different environments They've also confirmed that the presentation will be livereamed and that the CES show floor experience will continue from January eth through eth at the Las Vegas Convention Center. As part of the same CES presence Hyundai has confirmed that Boston Dynamics will publicly debut the next generation Atlas robot at CES for the first time This is the first time the new Atlas is being shown on a public stage Hyundai has said Atlas will be featured during the media day presentation and also demonstrated on the show floor In addition to Atlas, Hyundai has confirmed that live demonstrations will also include Spot and Mob ED. According to Hyundai, the booth will feature interactive scenarios a recreation of its robotics research environment and hourly presentations explaining how these robots are used in real environments MauiD specifically music is described as a compact mobility platform designed to carry sensors equipment or payloads across uneven terrain using AI based navigation and perception Next, moving from industrial robotics into the home LG Electronics has announced that it will showcase its new home robot called Clo ID at CES 2026. music Clo ID is built with two articulated arms and each arm has multiple degrees of freedom Each music hand has five individually actuated fingers designed for object handling and manipulation LG has said the robot includes a head module with a display cameras microphones music speakers and additional sensors for navigation and interaction Clo ID runs on LG's affectionate intelligence software layer which is designed to support voice interaction contextual awareness and task execution According to LG's announcement CES 2026 will be the first public showcase of Clo ID. The company has positioned it as a home assistance robot capable of interacting with household objects opening doors and cabinets handling laundry items and supporting music basic daily tasks LG has tied the showcase to its",

The company has positioned it as a home assistance robot capable of interacting with household objects opening doors and cabinets handling laundry items and supporting music basic daily tasks LG has tied the showcase to its automation and assistance music Now moving into appliances and smart home systems Samsung has a large presence centered around what it calls its AI living ecosystem They're hosting a standalone exhibition space during the show and they're also kicking off the week with the First Look 2026 event before the main show floor opens One of the headline products is a new bespoke AI refrigerator family hub This version includes upgraded AI vision features built using Google Gemini. It's the first time Gemini is being integrated into a refrigerator The system uses internal cameras to recognize food items track inventory and support user-labeled containers The AI Vision system also expands recognition capabilities compared to previous generations There's also a bespoke AI wine seller This system automatically scans wine bottles tracks storage conditions and organizes collections digitally It's presented as part of the same AI ecosystem as the refrigerator music and other kitchen appliances Alongside that there are newly designed AI powered cooking appliances This includes an over the range microwave and a slide-in range both integrated into the AI managed kitchen system These appliances are designed to work together within the broader ecosystem rather than as standalone smart devices Then there's the latest MicroRGB television lineup MicroRGB was introduced at earlier shows and for 2026, the lineup expands with multiple screen sizes using updated MicroRGB panels LG is also bringing display technology The company is debuting its first microRGB televisions and these sets use a new panel design capable of reaching refresh rates up to 240 hertz while maintaining a full RGB stripe structure This is achieved using dynamic frequency and resolution technology allowing users to switch between high resolution and high refresh rate modest Multiple screen sizes are confirmed including 75 in 86 in and 100in models These TVs will be showcased publicly and positioned as part of the premium display lineup Now, Nvidia has a confirmed keynote on the schedule The official CES listing shows CEO Jensen Hong delivering the presentation on January the The event description says it will cover NVIDIA's latest work across AI, simulation autonomy and physical systems Alongside the keynote Nvidia also has a broader presence planned across the show that includes sessions demonstrations and CES foundry programming focused on AI platforms robotics workflows, and physical AI systems While specific products haven't all been listed ahead of time the scope of the presence is clearly laid out in the CTA schedule Intel is bringing its Panther Lake processors to the show These chips are part of the Core Ultra Series 3 lineup and are built on the 18 Angstrom process Intel has positioned Panther Lake around AIP PCs, edge inference and",
