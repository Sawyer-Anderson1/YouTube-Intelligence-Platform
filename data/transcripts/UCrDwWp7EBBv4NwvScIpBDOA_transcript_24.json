I've got 15 minutes and want to squeeze in a workout, what can I do with a set of 10 pound dumbbells? When you live with chronic pain, they think it's all about symptom management. For me, a lot of that is also mindset management. I'm having an endo flare up today. What are some simple things I can do to help me feel better? I have eczema, and in the spaces that I'm in, like pageants, it's important that I show up looking my best. When you find out that your child has cancer, you feel helpless. Your mind is just spinning with what the possibilities are. Everything changed, like right away. It became really important to me to understand my CAT scan results before I talked to my doctor. I felt like if I understood, I would be more of an active participant in my treatments. Oh that's cute. Are there any eczema triggers in this? We're going to sprinkle in a few easy moves to get that heart rate up. All while keeping it real, and mom-friendly. Of course, you go to the doctor and they prescribe medication. But there is so much more that I could do to help with my care as well. Enjoy. I can take a picture of the plate before and after the meal, and it will calculate the calories and the inflammation score for that meal. We have a follow up appointment. Your time with experts can be very limited, so we would go in armed with questions to make sure that we would get the most out of those conversations. I track all my symptoms. So I actually invented a metric called \u201cBurtness\u201d which was how much of myself am I feeling? Knowing that I always have that care in my hands gives me confidence to go out for new opportunities. It allowed us to really feel like we have the facts. And our doctor is giving us his expertise, his experience, his gut instinct. My doctor's appointments have evolved much more into action planning than they have information gathering, I think helping others is all about giving them the tools they need to help them heal. Because empowered patients, they have better health outcomes.",
