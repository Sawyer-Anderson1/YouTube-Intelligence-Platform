If AI knows more about than more about us than we know about ourselves, you'll never go to a friend, bro. Who why do you go to a friend for recommendation? Because you feel good about the answers that they give cuz they personalize it for us. They personalize it for you. But AI will personalize to a level that a friend can't. If a friend is in bad mood, he will. But AI will be the nicest person. Oh sh I feel so bad for you. You know what? You've been working very hard. First of all, you should take a break. You get my point, right? It'll always be nice.",
