I would I also want to correct myself I'm not suggesting not to use LLM. Uh I suggest doing it in multiple passes like one pass just offline focus mode and then after that uh I mean I also take notes but I I try",

Uh I suggest doing it in multiple passes like one pass just offline focus mode and then after that uh I mean I also take notes but I I try things up I I do a second pass It's just like for me more structured this way and I get le I mean sometimes things are answered in the chapter but sometimes also it just helps to let it sink in and think about it Other people have different preferences I would highly recommend using LLMs when reading books For me it's just it's not the first thing to do It's like the second pass i By way of recommendation is to say I do the opposite I like to use the LLM at the beginning i to lay out the full context of like what is this world that I'm now stepping into but I try to avoid clicking out of the LLM into the world of like Twitter and blogs and because then you're now down this rabbit hole You're reading somebody's opinion there's a flame war about a particular topic and all a sudden you're no longer you're now in the in the realm of the internet and Reddit and so on But if you're purely letting the LLM give you the context of why this matters what are the big picture ideas uh but sometimes books themselves are good at doing that but not always So i this is why I like the chat GPT ape because it gives the AI a home in your computer when you are f you can focus on it rather than just being another tab in my mess of internet options and I think cloud code and these particular does a good job of making that a joy where it seems very engaging as a product designed to be an interface that your AI will then go out into the world and is something that is very kind of intangible between it and codex is that it just feels kind of warm and engaging where Codex can often be as good from open AI but it just kind of like feels a little bit rougher on the edges whereas like cloud code is just makes it fun to build things particularly from scratch where you just don't like you don't have to care but you trust that it'll make something like obviously this is good for websites and kind of refreshing tooling and stuff like this which I use it for or data analysis so I my my blog we scrape hugging paste we keep the download numbers for every data set and model over time now so we have them and it's like claude was just like yeah I've made use of that data no problem And I was like that would have taken me days",
