        "text": " Maybe you can talk about the the current two big competitors in terms of models Cloud Opus 46 and GPT53 Codeex. Which is better How different are they I think you've spoken about Codex reading more and Opus being more uh willing to take action faster and maybe being more creative in the actions it takes but because Codex reads more it's able to deliver maybe better code Can you speak to the differences there i Oh, I have a lot of words there um is as a general purpose model Opus is the best Like for Open Claw, Oppus is extremely good in terms of roleplay, like really going into the character that you give it It's very good at and it was really bad but it really made an arch to be really good at um following commands It is usually quite fast at trying something It's much more tailored to like trial and error It's very pleasant to used In general it's almost like Oppos was is a little bit too American. And I should maybe it is a bad analogy You probably get roasted i I know exactly It's it's Codex is German. Is that what you're saying i Actually, now that you say it it makes perfect sense i Or you could you could sometimes sometimes I explain it i I will never be able to think what you just said That's so true But you also know that a lot of the Codex team is like European. Um, so maybe there's a bit more to it i That's so true That's funny i But also Entropic, they fixed it a little bit Like Opus used to say \"You're absolutely right all the time And it it it today I still triggers me I can't hear it anymore It's not even a joke I just You This was like the the meme right You're absolutely right i You're allergic to sick of fancy a little bit Yeah, I I can't Some other comparison is like Oppus is like the coworker that is a little silly sometimes but he's really funny and you keep him around and Codex is like the the weirdo in the corner that you don't want to talk to but he's reliable and gets done i Yeah. i Um, ultimately this all feels very accurate I mean ultimately if you're a skilled driver you can get good results with any of those latest gen models Um, I like Codex more because it doesn't require so much charade It will just it'll just read a lot of code by default Opus, you really have to like you have to have plan model You have to push it harder to like go in these directions because it's it's just like like yeah can I go it Yeah, like it will just run off very fast and there's a very localized solution I think I think different is is in the post training",

Um yeah because I care about efficiency when I build it and I I have fun in the very act of building I don't need to have fun with my agent who builds I have fun with my model that i where I can then test those features i How long does it take for you to adjust you know if you switch I don't know when was the last time you switched but to adjust to the the feel because you've kind of talked about you have to kind of",
