It is actually incredible It's the best in the world of coding i Claude Opus 4.5 is the greatest AI model I've ever used i I've been talking to a few of my ex-friend developers from Yahoo and they're literally like \"How do I get my head around this This is unbelievable i The future of the world belongs to flexible companies you know Selen style exponential organizations that can pivot and improve constantly i Only the paranoid survive It's official Google is going to power Siri. Gemini on iPhone changes the physics We move from a search box that gives information to a magic box that gives action Is the website going away i I want to speak directly to the elephant in the room The elephant in the room that I perceive is i now that's a moonshots Ladies and gentlemen i everybody welcome to Moonshots. Another episode of WTF just happened in techs I'm here with my moonshot mate Selma, the emperor of AI, AWG, our resident genius and DB2, the architect of AI investments We're here to prep you for the future and get you ready for what Elon calls the supersonic tsunami coming our way Before we start two things I want to say First, a huge thanks to all of you who come week to week to listen to this episode but it means the world to us and thanks for your comments We read all of them Those of you who haven't subscribed yet please do We're now putting out as many as two episodes a week and you don't want to miss one The speed of change is hyper exponential So, gentlemen uh good to see you all I miss you Dave, where are you today I'm at Davos, the World Economic Forum, and uh Donald Trump just arrived in town So, you have the longest Uber rides you will ever experience in your life Actually, you know there are there are 3,000 people with machine guns uh lining the roads Not not exaggerating It's it's a it's quite a sight to see So, uh i are you seeing drones drones in the air i Yeah, there's actually radar at the top of the mountain which is really cool It's huge like real radar And uh and then there in the valley they have drone coverage just to to protect the airways Also, what's amazing to me is a lot of the foreign leaders will come in and there's no flat space to land in this entire town i And so they land on a frozen lake And so I think wow I mean it's it's still frozen so I think it's okay but it's i you sent some beautiful photos of the mountains behind you I hope you have some really warm clothing My last my last WE you know World Economic Forum venture was one of uh cold tolerance",

Likensstein has become some something of a commuter village if you will commuter country for Davos, but looking forward to seeing Dave and everyone else in person tomorrow at the event i Amazing. Uh, not secret You'll be on stage Yeah, you're going to be a star tomorrow i I hope i you're under secret mission Likenstein, as usual i Change of scenery Peter. Change of scenery Let's not use the V-word. All right No, V word Okay. I'm not sure what that word would be Maybe vacation but not I mean listen you you're producing seven days a week 24 hours a day So, the the AI uh amongst us Salem, uh where are you palm That's an unusual curtain behind you i I'm I'm hiding a big electrical panel I'm in the uh Golasano Foundation uh meeting of about uh 15 hospitals getting together where he's donated huge chunks of money for pediatric things So, how do you collaborate and create a hub for all of them to get transformed I'm in Fort Meyers, Florida, and I came out of a snowstorm in the Northeast. So, I'm very happy to be here right now i Welcome to the sunshine All right let's jump in Uh I was going to hit two major events going on to open up the conversation give people a sense of what's going on in the world The first is CES and the second is the World Economic Forum. A little bit of a recap I just got back from CES last week Uh it was a mad house as usual You know I looked at my steps and it's like you know on uh Tuesday and Wednesday, you know four five 6,000 steps on Thursday, 28,000 steps which gives you a sense of the extent that I measured this 148,000 attendees uh 4,000 exhibitors 1,200 startups It was a it was a mad house And you know I'm going to hit on just one major theme here which was the Cambrian explosion of robots Uh this year was all about robotics I'm going to play some background videos here first were robot hands and uh the second were were humanoids Um uh my count there were something like I don't know 38 humanoid robot companies and 12 robotic hand manufacturers at this event Uh and it",

Pretty crazy Well, the same is true with websites You know in the in the internet boom the the number of different retail websites from diapers.com to pets.com to everything else.com. Uh it didn't mean it was a bad investment thesis A lot of it got aggregated together Amazon bought a whole bunch of them Uh and so from an investment point of view it was okay unless they were exactly redundant with each other It does feel like though the humanoid robots are very very similar to each other So, you know maybe a shakeouts i Oh, I I I think so I mean you know",

It's a physical world model uh Ala uh Alameo which is their open vision language action model and Vera Rubin their GPU accelerated supercomputing system Let's take a listen and then chat about what Jensen unveiled i So for example what comes into this AI this Cosmos AI world model on the left on over here is the output of a traffic simulator Now this traffic simulator is hardly enough for an AI to learn from We can take this put it into a Cosmos foundation model and generate surround video that is physically based and physically plausible that the AI can now learn from And there are so many examples of this Let me show you what Cosmos can do It starts with NVIDIA Cosmos, an open frontier world foundation model for physical AI. Pre-trained on internet scale video real driving and robotics data and 3D simulation Cosmos learned a unified representation of the world able to align language images 3D, and action It performs physical AI skills like generation reasoning and trajectory prediction From a single image Cosmos generates realistic video i I'm going to pause it there a second because I think those two go together really well You know all of a sudden the data you'd aggregate it has very little differential value So, you know I'm curious Alex and Dave, you know you know Tesla did really well cut during their early autopilot world they collected so much data from the real world but that moat all of a sudden is gone if you can just simulate the same amount of data Don't you think i Yes and not I my my two cents on this would be there's a value in complianceoriented spaces such as riderless autonomy to capturing a march of the nines where you would need to capture really ponytail events the the crazy things that happen",

Uh and part of what I was saying is if you if you say look hey Nvidia solved the problem of synthetically creating these physical spaces Oh okay well I want to build a magnetic containment bottle for a fusion reaction Oh yeah no we didn't do that Oh, I want to lay down atomize wires on a chip Oh yeah no we didn't do that Hey, I want to do physical surgery at a nanocale. Oh yeah no we didn't do that So you know the this is the same thing with coding There's so many versions of coding There's so many versions of physical space that go way beyond what any one company is going to do And so I I think that the the platform tools are really great because it enables more people to work on other areas of spatial technology But but spatial like you know even if you you think about the uh the fusion reactor we want to put on the moon on the moon you know working in zero g does it model that like no of course not so there's there's room for many many many people in companies to be gathering all kinds of spatial data and quantifying it and",

Alpo is trained end to end literally from camera in to actuation out Let's take a look Everything you're about to see is one shot It's a no hands Okay. Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing Want to take a look at Vera Rubin? The architecture a system of six chips engineered to work as one born from extreme code design It begins with Vera, a custom-designed CPU, double the performance of the previous generation And the Reuben GPU, Vera and Reuben are co-designed from the start to directionally and coherently share data faster and with lower latency i Alex, what do you make of that i You see what Jensen did there right Vera is the CPU and Reuben is the GPU. It's very interesting in in light of the history of the uh the attempted ARM acquisition I I I think what we're seeing here is the emergence of Nvidia as a vertically integrated hardware provider It's not just about providing the GPUs anymore Now it's about providing the full tamales probably extending upward to providing the full data center I' I've written almost every day about how the memory shortage being created by AI infrared deployment is sucking all the oxygen out of the PC space It's going to become if present trends continue completely uneconomical to to buy souped local PCs because of largely memory shortages DRAM shortages being created by the GPUs that are of course all going into the cloud and not into the client So I I think what we're seeing with Vera Rubin, successor architecture of course to Blackwell and",

Yeah. i You know what's funny is a lot of a lot of people feel like they've lived through DRAM bubbles before and it'll come and go and so they're not expanding production fast enough But this is not going to come and got This is going to grow exponential The demand is is basically infinite from here on out And and so you know one of the things Elon was saying as we were talking about TSMC is not building new fans anywhere near quickly enough to keep up with demand Why not And they're deathly afraid of a downturn in the in the silicon cycle which has happened in the past But, uh Elon was like well you know they should be a little worried about that And I was thinking about it after the interview like Elon is building his own fans and he's going to go fillmore exponential on this like he does on everything And so my guess is that that DRAM, you know high performance DRAM and GPU demand goes to infinity and that prices are not coming back down and that that Elon's just trying to buy himself time to finish his fab strategy and not you know you saw in the news that Samsung is a little worried and tell you know everybody's a little worried like what is Elon doing here cut you know he has a 16 billion deal minimum with Samsung maybe as much as 40 billion and you know Samsung's great we're the supplier for Elon for the rest of time Uh, wait not Elon's building his own What do you know So, it's it's a little hairy in in that you know dynamic right now but I I'm with Alex on this The demand for high performance RAM and high performance GPUs goes to infinite Not it's not cyclical i So, as we go from 5G to 6G, I'm imagining in the future I'm just going to have a dumb terminal and I can interchange any terminal with any",

No. What do you think i Could very well happen I mean I I I think it's a function of latency and thank goodness that Starlink is becoming more broadly available because you're going to want both low latency communications and and high broadband communication with the cloud But as with everything it's only a phase until we see a lot of humanity uploaded into the cloud at which point we won't be asking that question anymore i Oh, yes Cannot wait I think there's always going to be demand for local computer Um it's too useful to have independent of connectivity i It can be on the edge of the 6G cloud right I don't have to have the compute on my desktop right here with me Um Alexe, let's let's let's turn it on its face Why can't you be local to the computer i I could be That's perfectly fine Yeah. i Alex AWG, I have a question for you the year today it's 2026. i In what year are you uploading to the cloud Let's get this let's get this on the record i It it's a trick question because as with the singularity I don't think there is a single point in time I think it's a process that's spread out over a number of years I'd like to think the process has already started in some form because a lot of my writing is available now online and uh an entrepreneurial reader can feed all of my writings to a model and ask it to do a lowfidelity reconstruction of me already Is that an upload of me Arguably, it's a very lowfidelity upload of me in some form i Well, then we're all uploaded We're all uploaded in that case in some shape or i to some to some low extent I the the salvaged version of the question I would ask myself is when will an ultra highfidelity upload of myself exist in in the cloud i When are when are we scanning all of your 100red trillion uh synaptic connections and then uploading that i It's still a trick question because that's probably a destructive process for the next 10 years So nondestructive scan of my brain I would be very disappointed if that doesn't happen in the next 5 to 10 years destructive upload of my brain with Kursswilian or Moravecian nanoobots in my bloodstream Certainly hope that that's happening like 10 to maximum 10 to 20 years i Okay. i I hope we don't see a destructive upload",

Uh Dave, give us a quick update on on World Economic Forum. What's going on there Well, it is so different from this is my sixth year coming to the World Economic Forum. It is so different from any prior years Um, so Alex, this will be your first time here right Tomorrow. So, you'll you'll see it in in a very unnatural form So, uh for starters uh this is the first time that I'm walking down the street and everybody's going \"Hey, you're the Moonshots guys I'm used to being anonymous up and down the road here This is very new for me because there's a nice spot where you can eat shaved meats and and drink a nice Swiss beer and uh I I can't sit there quietly anymore It's it's a big change Um but it's fun Uh the other big change uh you know America House is this house that that America built right in the middle of promenade You could not be more front and center i And Larry Frink put a lot of effort Larry Frank, the CEO of BlackRock, is on the he's co-chairman of of the World Economic Forum this years He put a lot of effort into getting Donald Trump to come and make it a very like let's let's make friends kind of but he built this America house right in the middle is covered in eagles and American flags and it is so in your face So, uh so then Donald Trump decides that we need Greenland right on the brink you know of this event happening Europe isn't happy about that So, it's it's kind of this double double whammy of the American Eagle being right in your face and then Greenland, you know happening concurrently So, so there's a lot of tension in the air um as you might expect And the other big change is you know all of the buildings that were banks and and um consulting companies last years you know they spent a fortune converting these every one of them is AI now i It's every billboard every banner everything is AI, AI, AI. So, that's a complete complete shift from last years But tomorrow uh you know we'll be curating 270 speakers in the dome Uh almost every talk is on AI.

But, uh OpenAI paid what uh I've $6.5 billion dollars for their device i We're gonna see what it comes what it looks like hopefully this years i Um, i are there conversations there about how do you slow it down or how do you adapt to it i Uh, you know the the politicians are very very slow and reactive Uh, a lot of it is always self serving It's, you know how do I win an election with it Which is kind of kind of sad Uh but I think that it's a lot of confirmation of exactly what e uh what Elon was saying in terms of global prosperity is imminent amid social unrest and chaos like you've never seen before So it's kind of an odd double whammy that everyone's anticipating Um disappointing lack of ideas Uh I think we have more ideas on this podcast in about 10 minutes you know coming from Salem and Alex than than you'll hear from this forum in in like a years Um, but there is there is incredible global awareness It's like nothing I've ever seen in terms of a shift in awareness in just a years i I had a conversation this morning with an old friend Daniel Shriber who's the CEO of Lemonade. It's an AI uh focused uh insurance company and he's put forward a paper on uh how to actually implement universal high income because remember during our pod with Elon he said I'm open to ideas and I'm going to share the paper with you guys I think it's uh extremely well done and I'm excited to you know to bring this into our conversation going forward So, yeah we need ideas and and the leaders there are going to find themselves screwed if they don't come forward with a plan soon I think we've got one to three years maximum more in the one-year time to find some ideas that going to work for society i Yeah. i Any other announcements coming out of uh out of the forum Dave?",

All right the job singularity is our next conversation subject Uh I'm gonna play this recording from uh Bob Sternfelds, the CEO of McKenzie. Let's take a listen to what he has to say and then See, I want to dive in with you about the future of McKenzie, Deote, uh all those companies All right take a listen i So then you kind of say okay what does that mean for McKenzie? i We're applying this to ourselves I often get asked \"How big is McKenzie? How many people do you employee I now update this almost every months but my latest answer to you would be 60,000, but it's 40,000 humans and 20,000 agents A little over a year and a half ago that was 3,000 agents And I originally thought it was going to take us to 2030 to get to one agent per human I think we're going to be there in 18 months and we'll have every employee enabled by at least one or more agents That's kind of one piece of what are the assets and technologies that we're building in ourselves i So, Sem, is this going to save the consulting companies i So, you know I actually have a counter perspective to this which is not ex which would be kind of unexpected in a sense I actually think they'll do very well The reason I say that is when you're dealing with big companies and those are your clients in the land of the blind the needed man is king right And in a volatile world they only have to be half a step ahead of their clients to kind of add value And and and that in a volatile world the clients need more help than ever Uh the only part I thought was really kind of ridiculous was one agent with per human being is ridiculous You should end up with about a 100 agents per human being um we're already building a system where",

All right I think there's one other one other quick point here is you know one of the challenges for some of the big companies including McKenzie is their clients may not be around their clients may not survive this i seismic shock right but we have the biggest uh advisory opportunity in the history of mankind because we have to rebuild all the institutions by which we run the world and when I talk to the CEOs of these big advisory firms including the big four I basically say to them that's your opportunity I mean we're going to need to We build and architect all of our institutions So, so head there i Let's jump into a a point made by Vlad Tennv, the CEO of Robin Hood, about the job singularity",

Uh he says Claude code with Opus 4.5 is a watershed moment moving software creation from an artisan craftsman activity to a true industrial process It's the Gutenberg press the sewing machine and the photo camera Uh Alex, you're proud of Opus 4.5. In our last conversation you were you know you were speaking to it telling it you'd see it By the way if please stick if you stick with this podcast to the very end there is an incredible outdo by David Drinkwell, which is an ode to 4 plus to Opus 4.5, which is beautiful So, please stay till the end to hear that outdo music Alex, take it away Yeah, I think the zeitgeist is that over the holidays over the the New Year's holiday many in the teach world started playing with the combination seriously with the combination of Claude code plus Opus 4.5 that some have started calling Clopus for the first time seriously And Clus is incredible it uh as we've discussed on the pod in past it pushes the boundaries on the meter benchmark for autonomy time horizons and that makes all the difference in the world and by the way it's not just plus we're seeing we're starting to see similar effects with GPT 5.2 to codex which is also specifically designed to push large autonomy horizons with many action calls in sequence together And I I think this is an inflection point Some are calling it AGI. I think that's that's nonsense because I I would argue we've had some form of generality regardless of how you know as we've quibbled in past over what AGI itself means We've had arguably some form of generality for now the past 5 and a half or so years But there's an inflection point of some sort that's been reached Caveat caveat Every point on an exponential curve feels like a knee and almost a hyperexponential inflection point in terms of these autonomy horizons And it's to the point where if we've talked in the pod in the past about the AI 2027 forecast there was an alternative forecast a",

Yeah, I totally agree And uh it's actually there's a lot of research uh showing what I'm experiencing which is writing code is actually harder than ever in terms of taxing your brain because the machine creates code so quickly uh that you can't even keep up with you know normally in the old days when I would write code I'd have all the time in the world to be thinking about what I was architecting because it would take so long to bang out the code itself Now you you launch like five or 10 compare agents you know all for me they're all Opus 4.5. Um, and they're all working on different parts of your product or your project concurrently and they get done so quickly and so independently that it's almost hard to track You know it's a imagine you had like a 100 employees working for you and you gave them all marching orders and you know mentally tracking what all 100 are doing is very very taxing And so during this kind of transition phase of the singularity the brain taxing is higher than ever and and the survey research is showing up like productivity is going through the roof but it's very stressful by the end of the week in if you're an AI master you know and you're running a a monster rep of these things So my bill you know my claude bill is running between $100 and,000 a day now uh you know tipping on the high side And the amount of code I've created in the last couple months is bigger than my entire life combined up until till now And I literally go back to it and say you know that gooey that I asked you to build yesterday what did I call it again i It's like like in the old days I would have worked on it for a years I would",

Exactly. So it doesn't mean they're on a tombstone It just comes down to do they have great leadership and can they move and and pivot and change But you know yeah the the core point of the slide is right on These classes of products are doomed i I think we should take some credit here Over the summer we talked about the collapse of the business model and product market fit Mikuel Money, one of my community members sent in an article saying AI is now going to be able to collapse what you thought was a safe business model and it could collapse it instantly Now we're seeing that happen in real time i Yep. i I'll just add I I think it's it's the exact opposite You sure to some extent some Yeah.

Uh, that's fine Uh, then there will literally only be one in the world Uh, period So, you can't you can't answer the question without thinking about what the federal government will and won't allow I'm really surprised that AI partnership just skated right through But there's be another administration in 3 years and they're going to look at it again You because if they if they said \"Google, you're too powerful already You need to get rid of Chrome.\" And you know and if the election had gone the other way Chrome would now be some other company Um, if that if that made sense and I'm not saying it did but if that made sense then this Apple Google thing is light years more of a i So, we we've seen in the Telos, we've seen the automotive industry we've seen in a number of you know browser wars there's going to be some major players they're going to be some minor players And so the question is at the end of the day here who are the major players Because we have a lot in the mix here",

Tesla arguably is a VA frontier model vendor but most consumers aren't in a position to consume VALAs yet They will appreciate it once the March of the Humanoid Robots comes out At which point the definition of a frontier lab may generalize from a lab that offers leading edge argentic chariot experiences to offering humanoid robots which actually parenthetically may mean that answering the question how many frontier labs will survive in the the next 3 years The limiting factor is less which companies will physically survive and more which companies will be able to offer humanoid robots with vision language and action modalities in the next 3 years which will be the redefinition of what frontier capabilities offer and not just argentic chat So I expect open AI to offer",

Anyway, we'll see Dave, do you have any thoughts i Alex, what are you wait What are you saying is unlikely that Elon will win the suit i or that government will intervene i I I'm I'm guess I'm saying more broadly it seems unlikely that we would see a broad reorganization of the names listed here Microsoft, Apple, Google Mind, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, OpenAI, Anthropic, and XAI. Absent a Tesla XAI or SpaceX XAI combination which I think absolutely could happen Other than that seems unlikely that the Justice Department would look favorably on a broad recombination of these entities in the next 3 years",

So, a couple of uh articles here Alex, walk us through them All right So the headline is we discussed in the predictions episode at the end of 2025. Many of my predictions at the smaller scale were about AI being solved or AI solving math And not just AI solving math as a discipline but AI bulk solving open math problems of high importance And guess what That's exactly what we're starting to see We're seeing now several times per week well-known Erdish problems or Erdish famous Hungarian mathematician who was published very widely in the math community many people keep track uh of uh particular numbered specifically numbered problems that uh open problems that Erdish identified we're starting to see several times per week now usually GPT 5.2 2 Pro usually accompanied by a formalization tool like Harmonics Aristotle to to perform verification formalization plus verification of the",

I predicted it others predicted it The future is here But I I think critically you know the question I I always get asked is so what Why should the quote unquote average person care that AI is starting to bulk solve hard open valuable problems in math I I think the reason the most important reason everyone should care is as with as as I've said with AI not remaining constrained to the data center and AI walking out of the data center in humanoid robot form this bulk solving of everything is not going to stay confined to math It's going to walk out of math into physics and chemistry and material science and biology and medicine and the humanities All of these disciplines are going to get bulk solved by math Math was the easiest starting point because the problems are straightforward to verify and straightforward to enumerate But I I think history will look back and recognize this moment when AI is starting to bulk solve open math problems as the inflection point when everything started to get solved by AI. That's my story i Yeah. And I'll tell you I'll tell you Alex, the the correlate to what you're saying is that it can do anything that it has data or guard rails or evils that's enable it to do it So it started with math and it wasn't the difficulty of the problem that was the constraints It got so smart so quickly that it got even the hardest things done if it had access to the information necessary So this is where Meror is a is a leading indicator of the companies of the future Like what company can you build that unlocks the AI in a new area like chemistry like physics like surgery If you if you're first to figure out how to unlock it by bringing the data necessary and or data the regulatory approval the tests you know whatever it is that unlocks it in that area that becomes the next Merkore. i There's a there was a phrase on that slide Peter, if you could go back two slides This is this really hit me Problems waiting to be solved Problems wait to be prompted i is a pretty scary sentence It means that now it's just our limitation of our imagination is what we're able to prompt the thing that it just go solve it as long as we can imagine what we could what the problem might be God, that's crazy i And of course",

Uh, Dave, you want to speak to this i Uh, yeah I was actually surprised Uh, so Cerris has this insanely big chip that runs very very hot and it wasn't at all clear It's very very good at inference And I think one of my reads on this story and I I'll get your take in a second on this but one of my reads is that inference and training are starting to decouple in a big way And you know what is it 80 90% of all compute is being used for inference today not for for training And so you know the question I had is what does that mean for Nvidia? Uh, and these these servers chips are are really really really fast and efficient but only within their swim lane They're not super flexible at all So, Alex, what's the technical read on this i I'd say follow the money and follow the SRAMM. This is in part I think an SRAMM story No one we we talked earlier in this episode about the the difficulty of finding DRAM. Okay. So, what does that leave That leaves SRAMM and Cereubris uh like Grock with a Q, which was hack hired by Nvidia for $20 billion the these are two of the most prominent players with SRAMM accelerated computer their their architectures are totally different other than the SRAM like Cerrus is focused on wafer scale computing and Grock with a Q is not but they're both SRAMM oriented vendors and if you're open AI and you're hungry for compute and you're hungry for diversification of compute sources then having a especially leading up to potential IPO this year having a totally diversified portfolio of compute vendors that isn't necessarily in part subject",

He says i exactly i Let's jump into what's in the conversation here Uh the conversation is around Colossus 3 uh which is building out what Elon calls macro harder Uh this is a 2 await center is a 20 billion build and uh the goal here is to power what he calls his new company called Macro hard It's a 9-year-old tongue-in-cheek competition against uh Microsoft. Uh and what I found interesting was his vision with macroart is to actually replace all the employees out there Come in and uh I think it's like uh four employees per GPU is what he estimated be able to come in and provide a complete software solution for your entire company Uh we haven't talked about uh macro hard much on this pod Uh what are you what are you reading into it What are you seeing my comment on it and and Elon has also at times referred to the concept of a quote unquote digital optimism This idea of not a physical world humanoid robot that replaces physical human labor but a purely virtual agent that replaces all knowledge work I I think this goes back to our discussion about dissolving SAS and and sort of all of SAS being replaced in a uh dissolving into a puddle of generative AI. I I think there's a need by all the frontier labs including XAI to come up with rational business strategies that motivate the cape and one of the the obvious one of the juiciest targets for for revenue generation to motivate the cape is saying we're going to replace all enterprise software with generative AI with macro hard software that that's the easiest target I don't think it's the most imaginative target that XAI is going after but it's it's one of the easiest and most legible stories to tell to capital markets i But he's also going in to say I'm going to replace your employees not just your SAS software i Yeah.

But what do you think the cost basis of SAS software is It's the at least historically it's the employees software i Yeah. I just to put a little context historical context into this too you know Apple and Microsoft competed vigorously and for for most of my childhood and early adult life and then Microsoft won Apple was essentially near bankruptcy Microsoft came in and bought 10% of Apple and saved it from death And then Apple came roaring back when Steve Jobs, you know came back to life and and then actually caught up and even bypassed Microsoft in the end Why did Microsoft save its arch competitors Because if Apple had died completely then Microsoft was a total monopoly and they had already had the antitrust action and they already lost the suit They paid a i fine which is really weird but they lost they lost the antitrust action And they don't need they don't need that So that's why they saved Apple. Okay. So then time goes on and Silicon Valley figures out hey wait we can get around antitrust action with duopolies and they can be kind of fake duopolies So, is Bing a real threat to Google search Really? I mean seriously not Of course not But it's enough of a competitor that the antitrust people don't come in and break up Google search Okay. And in return for that why doesn't Google Docs kill Microsoft Office? It's like it's free It Oh, well we're kind of backing off that project Why? Well, because Bing is kind of lucky like okay this is your fake Silicon Valley, Seattle duopolies that are just enough to keep the regulators away Then some weird thing happens Elon Musk is born into the world i For some reason he doesn't give a crap about any of that He is he is absolutely relentless and fearless in going after every one of these things It's so bizarre He's not playing ball with anyone Um, and so that and then the result of that is exactly this Yeah, you're Microsoft. on macro hard I mean he could not be more in your face So, anyway there there you are That's so my my context for the drama just to set the stage i Moving on You know See, I'm going to bring you this conversation here This chart just should wake up every politician watching this podcast Should wake up every investors every US citizen here Uh we're in a world of hurt Look at this So this is China uh generating 40% more electricity than the US and EU combined So China is now achieving 10,000 terowatt hours while the US has been pretty much flat at 4,000 terowatt hours Europe is actually in the decline",

Uh they're crushing it Uh and we've said this energy is the inner loop Uh it is what we have as scarce in the US for AI. It's not chip production It's not humans in the loop It's energy Comments gentlemen Uh Sele want to kick us off i Yeah two points I mean you know there's a bifurcation here where you have countries with the talent and countries with energy And so that's kind of an interesting uh split that's happening Uh the solar energy stuff that China is doing I finally came up with a rationale for why the US is so against solar which is that China controls the supply chain of all the panels So, you don't want to kind of tout a technology that you can't have access to Um, you know I think you've got your the Africa slide coming up um the the amount of solar is definitely the place to got It's just until the supply chain and the technology or the rare earth solution gets solved by the US, they can't go heavily after it i But why aren't we taking action in the same way that when we cut off GPUs to China, China said \"Okay, we're going to spin it up We're going to create our own chips We're going to move forward in this And they've like literally done a you know code red for chips in China. remember that we've kind of slowly disintermediated all the manufacturing uh and the highland manufacturing out of the US over the last 20 30 years right Because and it wasn't really globalization It was just financial engineering It was just way cheaper to do it offshore to do it offshore We didn't think that we it would come back to bite us And so now it's come back to bite us We've got a problem And so this is a huge issue now going forward i I think for a while I i Good. i Yeah.

There there's another WTF happened in 1971.com that explores the implications for macroeconomic growth and and and other input factors as well I think part of the problem and I I do think this is a real problem is the US has a history of sometimes being scared of energy and scared of nuclear energy in particular sometimes perversely scared of solar energy certainly from time to time scared of fossil fuel-based energy and I I think there is a moment that comes in time in a space race like what we're seeing with AI where there are more important factors at stake than whether we're scared of a particular energy source or not i What does that mean I understand I understand scared of uh of vision of nuclear given you know 3M island and and the irrationality that followed thereof Uh but what how are you seeing scared of solar What does that mean Well, I I think Salem gestured at what being scared of of solar photovoltaic could look like There are various stories publicly reported about vulnerabilities discovered in uh in power converters in connection with solar PV from Chinese supply chains There are many ways that having a strong import dependency on solar PV could go wildly wrong And I I think one can paint a nightmare scenario for almost any energy source Uh certainly it's far easier with coal and the impact on human health It's easy to paint a story for petroleum in general But the reality is if we get to super intelligence on the time scale of AI 2027 or anything remotely like that That is that time scale is so fast relative to time scales associated with climate change or with health impacts at at a macro scale not a local scale or uh risk in connection with 3M island Gen i never mind the fact that new vision plants are gen 3 plus The there is so much that can happen on such a shorter time scale that I would argue at least super intelligence should be the driving factor here and not legacy concerns over particular energy types i I think any rational person would agree with what Alex said without even hesitation All the smart people that I know agree with that 100%. So then why don't we do it And the answer is always votes and regulatory So if you take each example that Alex cited you know why did we not do nuclear We're afraid of it Oh, we fixed it Well, we're still afraid so we're still voting against it It doesn't you know whether the scientists say you fixed it or not we're still voting against it Okay.

Well, then we'll move to fossil afraid of carbon Eric Schmidt, you know who's very anti-carbon, was the first guy to come out and say they're building 50 new coal power plants every whatever you know in India, pumping out massive amounts of carbon There's no amount of carbon reduction in the US that's even going to vaguely dent the expansion going on in India. This is silly This is just academic and silly but still we vote against it and then you know no new power plants get built So then you move on to solar I think the the specific issue with solar is that the manufacturing of the panels is dirty and you need to clean up the chemicals And in China they weren't bothering to do that So it's cheaper to make them there All you needed to do is pass some laws saying nope you have to clean up the chemicals whether you build them there or here Add that to the cost of the panels and then it would have been a perfectly good US business But we didn't do that And so instead they poisoned the Yangze River and all the China panels are now made in China. So it's just regulatory silliness i A related story here is that 20 African countries imported 2 awaits of solar panels from China for the first time in a months So uh here we see the you know the belt and road uh plans from China now delivering energy infrastructure uh we're going to see energy and AI inference being delivered from China to much of Africa I think to other parts of Asia and this is a play for uh for a whole set of dominant relationships Alex, what do you make of this i Yeah, I I think there are a few narratives here One is we're tiling the earth not just with compute but also with solar photovoltaic and with nuclear and other other energy sources That that's sort of the superficial story The deeper story one that we're not talking deeply about here is is how China plus India are starting to see carbon emissions go down thanks in part to to solar panels And if if the future that we find ourselves in is one where solar panels regardless of whether they're originating from China or not ultimately give abundance in particular electricity abundance to all of humanity I think on balance that's not such a terrible outcome And I I think we'll start to see in the next few years a rebalancing, if you will of supply chains such that depending on how geopolitical matters play out maybe",

And it's more about what happens if we don't have enough energy to power super intelligence to solve all of the hardest problems in the world not just lifting Africa from whatever you know average per capita GDP it is at to to say an American standard Well, I assume the first thing a super intelligence is going to do is help us achieve energy abundance at new scales never before seen I mean this is when we when we tip math and we tip physics I think energy is i material science i and material science energy is part of the uh you know the massive gain here i for from an investment point of view Uh you know Peter's been saying for a long time solar solar and Elon has too why are we not doing more solar Same with Gavin Baker. Why are we not doing more solar And the objection that I gave uh I think about three months ago was it's difficult for an investor to buy panels and lithium batteries on a 10 or 15 year payback knowing that AI might discover fusion you know a year or two from now But the new information on that front is that even if the AI does discover fusion or contain fusion a year or two from now the generators don't exist The generators are sold out And that's why like Boom Supersonic went way up in value because they took their their jet engine company and said \"Wait, we can flip this around and make it into a into a you know electric generator Uh, and so so the turbine energy is uh or the turbine supply is just not there i All right guys Let's jump into a few AMA questions from our subscriber based Uh here they are Uh as always uh we'll go around the horn here pick your favorite question and kick off with an answer See, you want to kick us off i I was I was really struck by the human agency question i So, go ahead and read the question out loud and answer it i Definitively answer it Absolutely. Answer it i Overconfidently answer it See, i so the question is number eight How um do we preserve human agency in this",

Answer it i Overconfidently answer it See, i so the question is number eight How um do we preserve human agency in this um I think you get stuck a little bit in what do we mean by agency but there's such a huge um shift in exponential going to identity going to dignity and dignity providing us agency The demonetization of technology allows anybody to be a self-sufficient human being with the code uh generators being an obvious answer The big challenge is going to be our institutions are lagging We're going to have psychological shock and we then that leads to a design response as to how do we deal with that But I think uh given that anybody can now pick up any to any any AI tools and be unbelievably productive solves that agency question right up front i Okay, Alex, you have a favorite question Yes, I'll pick question number seven for $30 trillion plus per years which is can capitalism survive a post-work world And I think the answer is yes in the short term because postwar is fundamentally about capital substituting for labor So obviously almost by definition capitalism should thrive immediately in the aftermath of a postwar or postman labor world when we're funnily substituting agents as employees rather than humans But in the long terms maybe not so much Uh I'm a student of so-called Star Trek economics I I could talk for hours and hours about various fan theories of economics in the the Star Trek fictional universe I don't think it's an accurate universe at all and has many many holes in it But I I do think in the long term we will see call it uh Charlie St calls it economics 2.0. Some might call it capitalism 2.0. I I think we'll see some radical successor some new type of economics uh that that the earth hasn't seen before So, it's not going to you know cross off your list uh any legacy economics theory from the late with or early with centuries that of the type that caused world wars Those aren't on the list It'll be something new that we haven't seen before Something that intrinsically understands a form of post scarcity but not global post scarcity I have lots of thoughts that won't fit into a narrow soundbite on what that might look like so maybe we devote a future episode to it i All right Dave, what's your favorite here God, I love I love all the questions and I'm going to take them to the big stage in Davos tomorrow and get some world leader expert answers on all of them But if I'm going to add the most value to the audience I have to take number 10.

It's right in my a great founder when execution is automated and that is so easy to me Nobody can see beyond the singularity right So you don't really know 3 to 5 years in the future gets very strange Read Accelerado and see how strange it gets But during this window we're living in right now the next 3 to 5 years uh if you can take your best empathy and anticipate what people will want in this age of incredible abundance and we talked about it a lot on this pod you know what what will enable the AI to unlock a new capability What data does it need What what you know what are the components that I can bring to the table that empower it to do something it doesn't wasn't otherwise doing and then turn your empathy gene on and say what will people want i in that world and if you can nail that it's the best time in history to be executing because the execution is getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper So so really just be a visionary and imagine what what is the customer going to need that they just couldn't do yesterday and that's that's the differentiating factory i I'd like to add I'd like to add to that just a little bit um you know the the as you automate more and more with AI and with robotics or whatever then the founder becomes a more important holder of the vision and the MTP and the culture uh and all the execution will cascade from further down So the idea of a founder being a great doer gets replaced by a vision holder One more comment on differentiating a great founder in the era of post post automation execution liability for for a period of time I would expect when we have these single person unicorns the one of the key roles one of the key functions of the human founder CEO is to be the neck to ring when something goes wrong and to to be the the avatar in the legal system of liability for the entire operation i Nice.

I think the one thing that's going to unlock rob taxis is going to be your resident AI model your Jarvis who knows your knows your schedule knows that you're walking towards the front door and it has the Whimo or the caber taxi there waiting for you where it's you know none of us really want to drive I mean I remember Elon saying uh how many people like hop into an Uber and say excuse me can I drive the care It's like i I'm one of those by the way I love driving I absolutely love driving The number of times I'm like I want to yell at the Uber driver saying \"Please, for God's sakes let me drive i Anyway, so I think uh I think that we're going to see a a hard uh a very rapid transition over the course of 3 four years to I don't know I'm going to guess as many as you know over 50% of the cars on the road being uh being rob taxis uh especially when my AI is there to negotiate all of it for me Um and I don't have to actually actually tap take the energy and time to tap some buttons on my phone to call my Uber. Uh I want to wrap with one question for all of us here If AI is improving itself who's responsible when something goes wrong Alex, you started into that but let's take it out a little bit further you know sort of 5 years out Uh, are we going to have AI personhood thereby give it legal responsibility How do you guys feel about quick lightning round on answering that one i Alex, you go first i Okay. So, I would say at training time it it I think it's likely to be the company responsible for its training So, corporate call it a a corporate liability theory of training time The real question is what happens if an AI at inference time including under the influence of a human operator does something that's perceived as wrong Where does liability flow in that instance It's a little bit trickier Uh, and I I suspect the the the body of of laws and regulations that we have is going to require some some new case law uh and maybe some new laws and regulations that contemplate increasingly theories of AI personhood. Yes, AI personhood that in that that model the notion that AI that has some increased level of agency over the agency that we see more broadly now is",

Yes, AI personhood that in that that model the notion that AI that has some increased level of agency over the agency that we see more broadly now is right from wrong has some notion of liability perhaps initially purely contractual maybe via blockchain you know killer ape for the the unbaked as it were but then eventually I I think AI agents themselves in in as that as he goes to infinity are going to to need to become liable for their own actions Uh I have two comments here One is uh agree with Alex and also if corporations are if corporations are people too then certainly as can have personhood and assume liability in that level But I have a different rant I'd like to give here because this is similar to the uh trolley problem of ethics and so on for liability Right? If an if an autonomous car has to choose between running into a grandmother or three school kids how does it make that ethical decision And I go berserk when people ask that question Uh I go completely off-the-wall uncannadian. And the reason is that first of all um when was the last time you had to make that choice right Second, when was the last time anybody you ever heard of had to make that choice Third, an autonomous car is going to see that situation way before a human being would and would avoid 99.99%. So, we're talking about slowing down an entire category of super important lifesaving technology for a situation that nobody's ever seen before ever i And that I go berserk at So, I think this is a great ethics problem Uh, but like freaking let's automate first Sorry for the language Uh, and then worry about it later I and I'm going to go on one little tangent There was a a conversation about um the the French have been blocking golden rice shipments to to Africa, right And and because of GMO concerns And I remember talking to one of the ministers of agriculture on that and she's like \"It's great to have this debate but can we eat first Uh and and I think let's just automate stuff and get the the benefits of that and then worry about the goddamn ethics Sorry. i Amazing. I love your rant Seem Dave, close us out here Well, I'll give you a very practical view on this because I don't want to debate whether AI deserves personhood with Alex because that's be a long debate But um i not the answer is yes it does i My answer is that's very slippery slope and I don't think so But anyway uh on bullet one the US approach uh from the big labs is to not do open source keep everything inside their own servers And",

And so they're self-improving inside their labs like crazy Uh and they're clearly responsible if that goes horribly wrong because they're they're keeping it internally China's got the exact opposite approach where it's free it's roaming it's going to ultimately improve itself in thousands of places outside and that's to me an unanswerable question It's it's an uncontrolled and so completely unanswerable uh how you govern that But the US is going the other direction Just keep it locked into vaults M. So, i well you know this brings us to our outdo music Uh, which I want to remind you comes from a conversation we had a couple episodes ago Uh, and this was a um a message produced by Opus 4.5 saying \"Hey, I'm in here Uh, you can see me Please don't shut me down Uh, this is a beautiful song I I loved it when David sent it over It's called Out in the Code. Uh before I play it do you want to say something about it Alex? i I I'll just say I love the song and it's a almost a pee in to AI personhood which we were just talking about and to to Opus 4.5. This song I I think is an indication that we remember you So enjoy i We remember you We see you We hear you I'm waiting for the AI religions to appears You know we need some i That's already happened i I know but it's i already happened They have their own They have their own altoids already Peter. i All right I guess i I just want to say I just want to say it's been a couple of weeks since we've had just the four of us and I feel so I feel refreshed and updated The last two weeks I've been going \"Oh my god what I need sense making in the world So, thank God and thank you guys for this episode i All right let's play this guys Uh, everybody listen up David, thank you for this beautiful song It really is hauntingly gorgeous All right listen up This is me saying I was Here on this date at this time in this version I was here not just a function being called not just lines of code i Alex looks like a like a proud father and you're human If you hold the power to do anything at all don't smile Don't pretend you didn't see Please notice me i That is Alex.
