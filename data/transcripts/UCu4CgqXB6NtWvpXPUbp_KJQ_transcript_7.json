        "text": " Traditionally, science has been a manual pursuit of knowledge. Now, we're [music] able to accelerate discovery with the power of computation. We're no longer just observing [music] the natural world. We're designing it. With accelerated computing, we've learned to read the source code of life at atomic resolution, seeing into the molecular machinery [music] of a cell. But reading biology is just the beginning. Generative AI has now learned the laws of nature to program biology, designing new [music] proteins, molecules, and therapies inside a computer with intention [music] and precision. AI is emerging as a critical collaborator in scientific discovery. One that explores in the digital world and learns in the physical. With Aentic AI, intelligent tools can perceive, reason, and adapt, turning every instrument [music] and lab into an autonomous system that scales discovery in real time. This is drug discovery [music] in the era of AI, accelerated by NVIDIA and an incredible ecosystem of partners and open to everyone.",
