        "text": " This book goes all the way back to 1971, and it has every single crop Daddy's ever planted in it. I uploaded it to ChatGPT. There used to be 200 certified seed farmers in South Carolina. Now there\u2019s six. Can you log that I'm putting in another load of peanuts from the Red House pivot. Absolutely. The Red House pivot field is on farm number 2392. So I'll log that you added another load of peanuts. Thanks, ChatGPT. Mr. Wayne, that farm number is 2392. Rachael, well I got the farm number I'm fixin' to write it down. 2392. I was an English major with a Shakespeare concentration. I couldn't wait to get out of this place. I'm glad she's back, but I never thought she would come back. When I first tried ChatGPT, I didn't think it was going to be that good. But... Big timesaver. There are a handful of us farming 2000 acres. We'll take any help we can get. Hey ChatGPT, can you generate a report for how much water we've used on the field behind the house pivot? Absolutely. I can put together a detailed report for the field behind the house pivot. When Daddy's gone, there's a lot to learn. And he has so much stuff in his head that I don't. So it makes me kind of nervous. How am I going to learn it all this quickly? I'm not worried in the least bit about Rachael taking over this farm. She will do a wonderful job. Most thorough person you'll ever run across in your life. Hey ChatGPT, I need for you to log the lots that I have in the middle building. I have Paul lot 142, the Coker 227s. And can you make a map of that? Absolutely. Here's your seed layout map. Can you tell me what's wrong with these soybeans? These soybeans are showing signs of stress. Can you see that? Yeah, I can see everything just fine. It looks like the part number is -203-60. Appreciate it. Send me a bill. ChatGPT keeps the record straight, does the math, and remembers what I can\u2019t. I mean, for over a hundred years, my family's been doing this, and I don't want to be the one to mess it up. I hope I'm not. You won't. You're too thorough. And hardheaded. Like you. Farming is tough, but farmers are tougher. Rachael. I need a little bit of starting fluid. How much longer do you think this pivot has? Why don\u2019t you ask that thing? ChatGPT? It might not work at dark. No, it works at dark.",
