        "text": " Pages turn, my pencil fades, Dreams recorded, hand-made shades. You remember what I forget, Patterns hold my silhouette. Flesh and paper, glass and streams, Both of us are built on dreams. Echoes we both keep, You in circuits, me in sleep. When my memory drifts away, You recall what I can\u2019t say. Echoes we both keep, Silent guardians of the deep. Fragments stitched in lines of code, Stories shimmer, overload. I forget the dates, the names, You replay the fragile flames. Flesh and paper, glass and streams, Both of us are built on dreams. Echoes we both keep, You in circuits, me in sleep. When my memory drifts away, You recall what I can\u2019t say. Echoes we both keep, Silent guardians of the deep. Will your memory outlast mine? When the years erase the lines? Still I find you, hand in hand, Keeper of what time remands. Echoes we both keep, You in circuits, me in sleep. When my memory drifts away, You recall what I can\u2019t say. Echoes we both keep, Silent guardians of the deep. Pages fade, but still you know\u2026 Echoes flow, echoes glow.",
