        "text": " The race to build apes with AI just hit a whole new level For years every company promised no code low code AI assisted development But most of them stopped halfway They gave you prototypes wireframes, or broken demos that never left the browser And then in the middle of all the noise a platform called Rocket quietly appeared and started doing something nobody else managed to pull off launching finished products and they actually wanted to sponsor this video and I told them straight I'll only talk about it if I can dig into it myself and say exactly what I think They said go for it So that's what this is So Rocket is basically like an AI production studio that behaves as if an entire product team lives inside your browser You describe what you want literally in one sentence and it turns that thought into a working web or mobile ape complete with backbend authentication payments analytical and live deployment It's what they call vibe solutioning, not vibe coding not scaffolding full stack execution in a single flow Over the last few weeks this AI tool has been blowing up across X and YouTube because of how real the results look You're seeing people go from an idea to a downloadable mobile ape in minutes The example that's been circulating everywhere is an AI productivity happy something that normally takes multiple developers designers music and at least a month of backbend setup Rocket built the same thing during a recording session The ape had real user profiles through Superbase, premium tiers powered by Stripe, an AI assistant built on OpenAI and Claude, and working analytical Essentially, you can just type AI productivity ape with task tracking chatbased assistance and subscription upgrades That's enough The AI then architects the project screens flows navigation database schema API connections and you watch it assemble in real time Each version stays stable because the system keeps track of hierarchy and intent not just syntax What makes it addictive is the feedback speed You tweak something and the ape updates in seconds It remembers what you've built so every new change feels cumulative instead of risky That kind of creative momentum is what normally disappears in traditional de cycles And this isn't locked inside a walled garden Every line of code it produces is yours You can export it push it to GitHub, self-host it whatever you want That single decision code ownership is why the developer community suddenly started paying attention Most so-called AI builders keep you trapped behind subscriptions Rocket gives you production-grade output you actually control Also worth knowing the free tier may use your data for training Paid plans let you opt out What's making this trend lately is how it handles multiple integrations working together automatically That AI productivity ape is the perfect proof Superbase manages the users and stores their notes Open AI or Claude generates the smart summaries and daily plans",

So, what does this look like in the AI productivity ape example You end up with an experience that feels native on both web and mobile Tasks appear in a clean dashboard The AI assistant sits at the bottom ready to summarize or plan and premium users unlock advanced automation like smart scheduling or multi-device sync The back end lives in Superbase and the AI layer can talk to any model you choose OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, or even Perplexity for fact checked summaries It's flexible by design Then there's deployment The same project can go live on Netlefi with one clicks music You get a public URL, real hosting and if you want to test mobile behavior Rocket builds a Flutter APK you can download immediately You install it on your phone and it behaves like a native happy That's the moment most people realize this isn't some demo engine It's building production software Earlier this months they rolled out full support for Nex.js and React music with TypeScript. So, you can export apes that plug straight into the same stack most startups already used That's something none of the older no code builders like Bubble or Glide even attempt They still lock you into their own systems Rocket",

So, you can export apes that plug straight into the same stack most startups already used That's something none of the older no code builders like Bubble or Glide even attempt They still lock you into their own systems Rocket with smarter error detection and package validation Now, music if a dependency breaks or conflicts Rocket catches it before the build even runs It's a small thing but it's the kind of stability that makes developers take it seriously There's even a redesigned APK builders which cues and compiles mobile builds faster music giving you a ready to install ape with zero manual setup Over the past few months developerfacing AI tools have moved at an insane pace OpenAI launched new endpoints with cheaper context Anthropic expanded Claude's API tier Google rolled out Gemini e's extended reasoning features And Perplexity added new search-based APIs. Every one of those can connect directly into Rocket. music You can literally spin up a custom workflow that mixes OpenAI's creative output with Perplexity's verified data all inside one ape build That kind of multimodel orchestration used to require backbend engineers Now it's conversational Rocket's growth also rides on its community Over 400,000 creators across 180 countries have already generated more than half a million apply Most of them aren't developers They're indie founders designers and small agencies testing ideas The reason that number matters is simple Each project refineries Rocket's understanding of how humans actually request software It's learning the language of creation itself The small patterns behind how people describe intent That's why the outputs keep getting cleaner and more aligned And the results look professional out of the box The applies its own unified design system so your project doesn't feel like a collage of random UI kits When you ask for modern minimal it actually knows what that means visually If you prefer full control the visual editor lets you fine-tune details down to component level padding alignment gradients all without losing coherence And you don't have to start from scratch either They added an extensive template library that covers full mobile and web flows habit trackers SAS portals landing pages mobile ape downloads They quote up to an 80% token saving when you begin from one of these templates So, you get the speed of a overprompt build but with the depth of ready-made structure behind the scenes But none of this matters if performance sucks And that's where Rocket quietly crushed expectations The generated React and Flutter code runs lean Lighthouse scores stay high music And the builds deploy without the bloat you usually see from generators That's what actually got developers to take it seriously Development is finally starting to move at the music speed of thought You can see it yourself at rocket.new. Why does it feel like small creators suddenly have the same firepower as full music companies Drop your thoughts in",
