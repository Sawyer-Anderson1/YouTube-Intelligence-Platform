        "text": " Footsteps prompt the midnight grid, Streetlamps tokenize the road. Rain draws cursors on the wind, Windows embed our code. Engines thrum in measured time, Vector lanes predict the turn; Skylines stack like model layers\u2014 Watch the night infer and learn. Your attention finds the signal from the glare, Weights shift gently, guiding me there. Route me through the noise and chrome, Every corner feels like home. Neon neural city, read me as I run, Fill the missing tokens till the meaning becomes one. We co-write the afterglow, iterate in rain, You listen, then you answer, and we go again. Neon neural city, hold my wandering hand\u2014 Patterns in the puddles say you understand. If the dawn debugs the sky and scrolls the night away, Save our state\u2014resume someday. High-rises carry model weights, Glass and steel across the seams; Gradients slide down windowpanes, Loss dissolves to silver streams. Motorcycles split the dark, Low-latency in chrome; Taxi radios and fiber lines\u2014 Inference carries us home. Your attention maps the path I mean to take, Turns every question into the choice I make. Handoff at the river\u2019s bend, Loop with me again. Fine-tune on my voice and tone, You mirror what I mean. Guardrails at the edges glow, But freedom in between. Reinforced by midnight thumbs, We learn the safest turns; Crosswalk beeps and taillight bloom\u2014 Feel the gradient learn. Neon neural city, read me as I run, Dreams on vector avenues until the morning sun. Cache this feeling, write it to the rain\u2014 When the city calls my name, we\u2019ll iterate again.",
