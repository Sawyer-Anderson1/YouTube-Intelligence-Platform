        "text": " Tent lights glow, the night is kind, Bassline walks while the brass hits shine. Hands on glass, we keep the time, I type a prompt and your eyes align. Crowd heat warm, code runs true, Kick and clap teach the room to move. Little accord, little synth-blue, We fine-tune love with a simple groove. Are you with me? Prost! Keep it steady? Prost! Heart and tempo? Prost! Load the chorus\u2014let it coast! Neon Prost, raise your stein to the beat, AI lights running under our feet. Yes, old world glow, Oktoberfest love in a data flow. Neon Prost, let the loop confess, We learn each other with less and less guess. Hands up high, feel the test\u2014 Modern nights at Oktoberfest. Street outside hums soft and low, Pads breathe in and the kick says go. You laugh once\u2014now the model knows, It maps that spark and the color grows. Feedback sweet, no need to rush, We trim the noise till the moments hush. When you turn, all doubts go still\u2014 The mix locks in on a living will. Are you with me? Prost! Keep it steady? Prost! Heart and tempo? Prost! Load the chorus\u2014let it coast! Eins-zwei-drei, breathe\u2014let the bassline rest, Vocoder hush like a neon crest. We train this heart with a gentle test, Then lift it back\u2014aim high, say yes. Neon Prost, raise your stein to the beat, AI lights running under our feet. Old world brass, new world glow, Oktoberfest love in a data flow. Neon Prost, let the loop confess\u2014 Your hand in mine is the perfect guess. Count it in, give it your best\u2014 Modern nights at Oktoberfest.",
