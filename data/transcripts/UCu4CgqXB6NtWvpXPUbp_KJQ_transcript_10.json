        "text": " [music] Vera Rubin arrives just in time for the next frontier of AI. This is the story of how we built it. The architecture, a system of six chips engineered to work as one, [music] born from extreme code design. It begins with Vera, a custom-designed CPU double the performance of the previous generation and the Reuben GPU. Vera and Ruben are co-designed from the [music] start to birectionally and coherently share data faster and with lower latency. Then 17,000 [music] components come together on a Ver Rubin compute board. High-speed robots [music] place components with micron precision before the Vera CPU and two Reuben GPUs complete the [music] assembly. Capable of delivering 100 pedlops of AI, five times that of its predecessor, AI needs data fast. Connect X9 delivers 1.6 [music] terabs per second of scale out bandwidth to each GPU. Bluefield 4 DPU offloads storage and security so compute stays fully focused on AI. The Vera Rubin compute tray completely redesigned with no cables, hoses or fans. Featuring a Bluefield 4 DPU, eight connect [music] x9, two Vera CPUs, and four Reuben GPUs. The compute building block of the Vera Rubin [music] AI supercomputer. Next, the sixth generation [music] MVL link switch moving more data than the global internet connecting 18 [music] compute nodes scaling up to 72 Reuben GPUs operating as one. Then Spectrum X Ethernet Photonix. The world's first Ethernet [music] switch with 512 lanes and 200 gigabit capable co-ackaged [music] optics scale out thousands of racks into an AI factory. 15,000 engineer years since design began. The first Vera Rubin MVL 72 rack comes online. Six breakthrough chips, 18 compute trays, nine MVLink [music] switch trays, 220 trillion transistors weighing nearly two tons. One giant leap to the next frontier of AI. Reuben is here.",
