        "text": " TCS has crossed $1.5 billion in annual AI revenue and has completed over 5,500 AI projects globally. This wasn't buried in an earnings footnote. Was actually announced deliberately at TCS Analyst Day 2025. More than 54 of TCS top 60 clients are already working with the firm on AI. 85% of clients with contracts above $20 million now use TCS for AIEL work and AI revenues alone are growing 16.3% quarteron quarter far faster than TCS's core business. Kitivasan said TCS is adopting an AI first culture where the first question is what can AI do here even if it cannibalizes our revenue end quote. That's not a throwaway line. For decades, IT services grew by billing more humans, more hours, more effort. Now, TCS is openly saying it is willing to automate parts of its own billable work to stay ahead. This is not a quarterly headline. This is India's largest IT services firm publicly committing to an AI future, even if it disrupts its own business model along the way. $1.5 billion in AI revenue is the milestone.",
