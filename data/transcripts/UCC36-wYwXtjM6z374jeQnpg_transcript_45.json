        "text": " There was a lot of concern, angst when I was meeting with CEOs, , consulting companies, investors in Europe, in Italy and in Spain. The GDP of Italy about 2.7 trillion, about the size of New York, the GDP of Spain, about 1.7 trillion, the size of Florida, but serious concern about can they compete and this is one of the biggest issues that's keeping them from competing, ability to access data. You know, Europe in general prided itself on having the strictest privacy laws out there. A lot of that simply meant that, okay, we're going to exclude everybody from Europe in a US product or service. The data showing that venture funding in Europe dropped, you know, up to 30% as a result of this and that the AI models in Europe have been 6 to 12 months slower to market than the United States. If you guys are interested in playing this, you need to build out your energy sources, identify where you're going to set up your data centers. I think the time frame for make those decisions and implement those decisions is the next five years. Yeah, it's now. It's literally now. More like five months than five years. Yeah, it's a little bit shorter than five years. Okay. I was being generous because you can't do anything in five months.",
