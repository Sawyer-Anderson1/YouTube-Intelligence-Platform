        "text": " OpenAI has launched a full-blown browser. The competitive positioning versus Google is basically all out war. Today, we're going to launch Chat GPT Atlas. This is an AI powered web browser built around Chat GPT. We think that AI represents like a rare once a decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be about. Okay, great. But Google's going to come in and do at least this and, you know, take back any market share they lose. I don't think we should think of it as a product. I think we should think of it as a distribution channel for open AI's super intelligence. Having a local agent mode I I think is potentially transformative. If Sam wins the data aggregation race, if he falls behind for a month or a year in the AI race, he still has your data. We're going to have an AI that is our [music] personal portal into everything. And I'm not going to care what browser I use. I'm just going to be able to have a conversation with my AI and it will pull up the [music] data from wherever it is whether it's using super intelligence from, you know, OpenAI or Google.",
