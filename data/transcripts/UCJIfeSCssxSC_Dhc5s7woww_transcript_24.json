        "text": " We didn't really mention programming That's another use case that a lot of people deeply care about So I use basically half and half cursor and claw code because there I find them to be like fundamentally different experience and both useful Uh what do you guys you program quite a bit So what what do you used What's the current vibe i So I use the codex plugin for VS Code. You know it's very convenient It's just like a plugin and then it's a chat interface It has access to your repository I know that cloud code is I think a bit different It is a bit more agent It touches more things It does a whole project for you I'm not quite there yet where I'm comfortable with that because uh maybe I'm a control freak but I still would like to see a bit what's going on and codex is kind of like right now for me like the sweet spot where it is helping me but it is not taking completely over I should mention one of the reasons I do use claude code is to build the skill of programming with English. I mean the experience is fundamentally different You're as opposed to micromanaging the details of the process of the generation of the code and uh looking at the riff which you can in cursor if that's the idea you use and and then changing altering looking and reading the code and understanding the code deeply as you progress versus just kind of like thinking in this design space and just guiding it at this uh macro level which I think uh is another way of thinking about the programming process Also, we should say that cloud code it just seems to be somehow a better utilization of cloud opus 45. i It's a good side by side for people to do So, you can have cloud code open you can have cursor open you can have VS code open and you can select the same models on all of them and ask questions It's very interesting like the the cloud code is way better in that domain It's remarkable",
