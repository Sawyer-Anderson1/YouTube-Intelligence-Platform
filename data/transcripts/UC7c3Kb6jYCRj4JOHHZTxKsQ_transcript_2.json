I told my cloudbot this is a video idea. Find relevant articles, videos, tweets, graphs that can be used alongside the article if I were making a full video going over it and on it researching visual assets. Okay, there it finally finished.

It actually went through the full article and grabbed all of the relevant source material, put together an outline for a video for me. All of this done in seconds. Build a content idea pipeline that researches topics, prevents duplicate ideas, and creates production ready tasks. And I'm going to drop this entire prompt in the description.",
