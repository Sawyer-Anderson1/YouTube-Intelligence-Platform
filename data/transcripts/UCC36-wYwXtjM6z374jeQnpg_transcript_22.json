But but I also believe Matt's totally right that that 2026 is going to be the year of recursive self-improvement and capabilities growing crazy exponentially and corporations moving at a snail's pace compared to what they could be doing And it's all going to be stuck and bottleneck and log jammed and it's going to frustrate the hell out of Google and OpenAI. And those bottlenecks are going to like they're going to be so lucrative for companies like Invisible to just plow them down It's going to be a really interesting foot race between those two different approaches",
