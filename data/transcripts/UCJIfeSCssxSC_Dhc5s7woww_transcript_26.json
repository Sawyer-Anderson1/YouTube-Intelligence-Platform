        "text": " Let me ask about your views on AI and LLM that are getting better and better mathematics and we've spoken about collaborators and you have so many collaborators i Do you see AI as a potential great collaborator to you as a mathematician and what do you think the future role of those kinds of AI systems is I guess I would draw a distinction between you know what we have currently and what might come in future years I've played around with it and I've tried um experimenting you know but I haven't found it helpful at all Basically zero It's not it's not helpful to me And you know I've used various systems and so on the paid models and so on And um my typical experience is interacting with AI on a mathematical question is that it gives me garbage answers that are not mathematically correct i Mhm. i And and so I find that not helpful and also frustrating like i if I was interacting with a person you know that the frustrating thing is when you have to argue about whether or not you know the argument that they gave you is right and you point out exactly the error and the AI saying \"Oh, it's totally fine And i and you know if if I were having such an experience with a person I would simply refuse to talk to that person again But okay one has to overlook these kind of flaws And so I tend to be a kind of skeptic about the value the current value of the current AI systems As far as mathematical reasoning is concerned it seems not reliable Um, okay But I know for a fact that many that there are several prominent mathematicians who I have enormous respect for who are saying that they are using it in a way that's helpful And I'm i often very surprised to hear that based on my own experience which is quite the opposite Uh and so maybe my process isn't any good although you know I use it for other things like you know for programming things or for image generation and so on It's amazingly powerful and helpful but for mathematical arguments I haven't found it helpful And maybe I'm not interacting with it in a in the right way yet or it could be um and so maybe I just need to improve my skills but also maybe I wonder like these uh examples that are provided by other people maybe involved quite a huge amount of interaction And so I wonder if maybe the mathematical ideas are really coming from the person you know these great mathematicians who are doing it rather than the AI. And and so so I tend to be kind of skeptical but also I'm skeptical for another reason and that is because of the nature of the um the large language model approach to AI doing mathematics Um,",

And and so so I tend to be kind of skeptical but also I'm skeptical for another reason and that is because of the nature of the um the large language model approach to AI doing mathematics Um, give me an argument that sounds like a proof rather than an argument that is a proof The motivation is misplaced And and so I I worry that this is a very dangerous source of error because it often happens in mathematics that I mean if I think back to when I was in undergrad you know here at Keltech and I was a math major eventually and at that time latte was a pretty new thing and I was learning latte and so I was typing up my homework in latte and they looked beautiful Actually, they looked like garbage From my current standards I'm sure it was terrible Except at the time you know I didn't know anything I was in undergrad and uh latte was sort of unheard of and so I was producing these beautifully type set you know problem set solutions and so on and i and I would print it up and submit it and so on and the grades would come back terrible grades i and and I realized what was happening is that the you know the the copy was so beautiful mathematically types set in this way It looked like the kind of mathematics you find in a book you know cut basically that's the only time you saw that kind of mathematical type setting was in a i in a professional you know published book clears throat i And those ma that mathematics was almost always correct in a book right i And so I had somehow you know lost my i critical because it was so beautiful and I'm used to only seeing that kind of type setting when an argument was you know totally right I wasn't enough and making these sort of bonehead mistakes in the proofs and and so I I corrected this of course i but this kind of effect is very much real with the modern LLM system and so I think that that the chat programs and so on are producing these arguments that look really i they look like a that's what they're striving to do that it's what they're designed to do They're not designed to make a logically correct argument They're designed to make something that looks like a logically correct argument And it's easy to get fooled if you're not skeptical And so that's why I worry a bit when people rely on AI for mathematical arguments I mean using tying them to lean and the formal proof um verification systems and so on this is a totally different way of operating But for the sort of ordinary person sitting down and using chat to come up",
