        "text": " Wireless networks are critical infrastructure. Connecting more devices than there are people on Earth. Soon, intelligent cameras, cars, and robots will create hundreds of billions of new connections. NVIDIA AI RAM modernizes wireless infrastructure into intelligent 5G and 6G networks, delivering scale, spectrum efficiency, and AI where the users are. In just 6 months, Nvidia and our partners built the first AI native wireless stack made in America, powered by Nvidia AI aerial. It's already running applications like Spectrum Agility. When radar interference would normally shut an entire system down, AI freezes only the affected frequencies, keeping the rest online. Another development enabled by the AI win platform is integrated sensing and communications. Researchers are fusing camera vision and radio into a sixth sense for wireless networks able to spot and track an object's location and path. Even when camera feed is lost, all in real time with NVIDIA AI aerial wireless is no longer just about connecting devices. It's about connecting intelligence.",
