I think it does something bad to us to kind of like treat entities in the world that look very humanlike badly, like taking over a robot. Yeah. There's a sense in which every future model is going to be learning what is like a really interesting fact about humanity. Namely, when we encounter this entity where we're like kind of completely uncertain, do we do the right thing and actually just try to treat it well or do we not? And that's like a question that we're all kind of collectively answering in how we interact with models.",
