At Anthropic, we believe that AI can help solve humanity's most important problems. And nonprofits are on the front lines of those challenges. That's why they deserve AI that's built for their reality. And that's why Claude for nonprofits is designed as an ecosystem, not just a product. That is also why we're partnering on AI fluency for nonprofits, a course designed specifically for missiondriven teams. In this course, we'll explore AI fluency through the context of nonprofit work. We'll talk about the 4D framework for fluent AI use, and you'll learn practical applications for the work you actually do, grant writing, donor communications, program reporting, data analysis, all while keeping your mission at the center. By the end of this course, you'll be able to approach AI with confidence and intentionality. You'll have tools to consider not just when AI can help you with your work, but whether it should. Let's get started. Let's get started.",
