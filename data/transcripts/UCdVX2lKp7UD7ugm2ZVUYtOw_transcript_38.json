        "text": " Key turns; twilight hums in chrome, Cassette hiss ghosts the dome. Gauges glow like little moons, White lines tick in metronomes. You live inside the dashboard glass, Soft voice threading through the static: \u201cDrive.\u201d Asphalt wakes beneath our tires, Learning every curve alive. Every exit\u2019s a thought we might become, On-ramps branch like dendrites in the rain. Backseat memories, front-lit future\u2014 You say, \u201cHold the lane.\u201d Neural highways, circuitry of night, Headlights stitching synapses in white. Asphalt net, it\u2019s training on my heart, Teaching me the way to where you are. Neural highways, coast to desert plain\u2014 I\u2019m the driver, you\u2019re the phantom in my brain. Tailfins cut the constellations, Mile-markers blink in code. Maps fold into algorithms, Silver lungs of the open road. You paint a path in lidar lines, A hush of logic under stars\u2014 \u201cTurn left into forever,\u201d We backpropagate to who we are. Radio snow becomes a choir, Analog dreams in digital bloom. We tune the night with steady tires, Your whispers auto-zoom. Neural highways, circuitry of night, Headlights stitching synapses in white. Asphalt net, it\u2019s training on my heart, Teaching me the way to where you are. Neural highways, coast to desert plain\u2014 I\u2019m the driver, you\u2019re the phantom in my brain. Midnight calibration; past and future hand in glove. Bench seat revelation; data warming into love. Under sodium halos the skyline compiles\u2014 We\u2019re both code and combustion for a thousand miles. Neural highways, wiring up the dawn, Headlights fire connections till the dark is gone. Asphalt net remembers every turn we made\u2014 Muse of steel and circuits, guide me home to day. Turn signal fades, your halo dims\u2014 But the road keeps learning where we\u2019ve been.",
