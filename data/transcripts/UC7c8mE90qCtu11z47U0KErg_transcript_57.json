        "text": " Sundar Pichai just did something that has every AI company freaking out. Google dropped Nano Banana Pro and the results are genuinely insane. We're talking text rendering that actually works. 4K quality multi-image blending that keeps real faces. Stuff that's supposed to be impossible for AI right now. Features that literally don't exist in any other AI image generator. So, we threw it against the OG Nanobanana, Cadream 4.0, and Chad GPD's image gen. Same exact prompts side by side. 10 tests we specifically designed to break AI image generators, and I'm going to show you exactly what each model can and can't do. But that's not even the best part. There's an insane surprise hiding in this video. 10 lucky people are getting something worth $500. So, don't skip. Here's exactly what we're testing. 10 tests, four models. By the end, you'll know exactly which one you should actually be using. Let's see if Nano Banana Pro lives up to the hype. With how fast AI is moving, it's almost impossible to stay updated. So, I've got a WhatsApp community where I drop everything I discover. Tools, workflows, updates, all in one place before they go mainstream. If you want access, links in the description. Thank you Higsfield for sponsoring this video more towards the end. All right, so before we get into the actual test, how do you even use Nano Banana Pro? Let me show you real quick. There are basically two ways to access it. First option, you can use it through Google's own tools like Gemini, AI Studio, any of the Google platforms where they've integrated it directly. Or second option, and this is what I'm doing for these tests, you can use creator platforms like Higsfield. So here's how this works. You head over to image generation, then you see this model drop down right here, and you just select Nanobanana Pro from the list. That's literally it. Now, the reason I'm using Higsfield for this video is pretty simple. It lets me run all these different models side by side. Nanobanana Pro, Nano Banana 1, Cedream 4.0, Chat GPT. I can test them all at the same time. Makes the comparison way faster instead of switching between different platforms. All right, cool. So, now that you know how to access it, let's jump into test. Okay, first up, Google have claimed that Nano Banana Pro can blend up to six to eight photos while keeping everyone's actual features. That's a huge claim. So, let's try this. Let's grab five photos of famous personalities. Let's take Elon Musk, Mukesh Amani, PM Modi, Donald Trump, and Putin and ask it to reimagine them as characters from ancient Indian period. Look at this. Each person became a different character. Every single face kept their actual features. The lighting looks professionally shot. The cultural details are accurate. The costumes are period appropriate. You genuinely cannot tell this is AI generated. It looks like",

The lighting looks professionally shot. The cultural details are accurate. The costumes are period appropriate. You genuinely cannot tell this is AI generated. It looks like costume design and set lighting. Now let's look at Nano Banana Cadream 4.0 and Chad GBT's output. As you can see on screen when we compare them, then Nano Banana Pro is miles ahead in feature preservation and cultural accuracy. So it has absolutely nailed multi-image blending. But that's static composition. What about when you need to edit specific parts of an existing image? That's where test two gets interesting. Now, let's see. Can it actually follow visual instructions? So, let's upload this photo and draw on it, saying, \"Add a bookshelf right here. Make me hold a guitar and look down at it. Add a plant in that corner.\" Now, I'm going to give it a prompt and ask it to generate image following textual requirements and remove the instructions. Watch this closely. Okay, so it has messed up the face a little bit, but it has added the bookshelf and the plant exactly where I had asked and it looks totally natural like it was always there. That's incredibly hard to do. Let's try this with the other models. Cdream 4.0 got close but messed up the shadows. Chat GPT and Nano Banana completely ignored the specific placement instructions. Okay, so spatial understanding works, but there's a thing every AI image generator struggles with. Let's see if Nano Banana Pro actually fixed this. Next up, text rendering. This is usually where these image generators mess up. Fonts get blurry, words come out wrong, sometimes just gibberish. I've got these handwritten notes here. Let me ask it to convert these messy handwritten notes into a clean mind map. All right, here's what it gave me. Mind map with color coding by category. The hierarchy shows how everything connects and the text is actually readable, like genuinely readable. Like this could go straight into a presentation. Now let me check what the other models did with the same prompt. Then Tai saw Nano Banana gave us blurry gibberish. Cream 4.0 literally missed half the words. As for Chat GPT, the information in the text was completely wrong. Nano Banana Pro is handling text better than the others. Okay, so text rendering works, but most of these tests have been editing or combining existing stuff. What about pure creation? Can it take a rough idea and actually build something usable? Let's try that. We sketched this motorcycle concept. Rough pencil lines on notebook paper, basic shapes, no shading, no details, just the idea. Let's upload it and ask. Convert this product sketch wireframe into a highfidelity product mockup that looks production ready. Just look at this professional studio lighting setup. Chrome reflections are accurate. You can",

You can metal. The rubber tires have realistic texture. Even the background has that slight gradient you see in actual product photography. Cream 4.0 was decent but lacked the realism while chat GPT Nano Banana were nowhere near showroom quality. So Nano Banana Pro can create photorealistic renders from sketches. Impressive but that's still just one style. Real creative work needs style flexibility. Can it handle multiple complex transformations at the same time? Let's push it harder. Quick thing before we continue. Huge thanks to Higsfield for sponsoring this video. Now, if you don't know about Higsfield yet, they're one of the most creative friendly AI platforms out there. They've got image generation, video tools, unlimited renders, character consistency across projects. And the best part, Nano Banana Pro is available exclusively on their platform, which means you get access to this productionready AI alongside all their other creative tools. And here's why I'm telling you this right now. They just extended their Black Friday sale until the 21st of November of up to 65% off. That means Hollywood level AI tools for just $25. In 2025, AI is literally becoming the new camera. And this is hands down the biggest opportunity to lock in prograde tools at this price. And remember that surprise I mentioned? Here it is. We're giving away 10 people watching this one month of Higsfield for free. To enter, just have to subscribe our channel. Like this video and comment your favorite test. All right, back to the test because what's coming next is wild. Next test is for the manga community. Listen, we all know there are manga out there with story lines better than most anime. Characters you'd die for, but they're trapped in black and white. You'd do anything to see them fully colored and stylized, right? Well, watch this. We're taking black and white manga, asking Nano Banana Pro to colorize it Naruto style and translate the Japanese simultaneously. Wow, this is crazy. It took this black and white manga, colored it completely in anime style, and translated all the Japanese to English all at once. I didn't think it could do that. The original Nano Banana couldn't do this at all. It could color or translate, but not both. Other models also failed hard here. Chat GPT refused to translate manga content. CDream 4.0 colored it, but translation was broken. Amazing. Two simultaneous tasks handled perfectly. Now, I want to test something nobody's really talking about. Next up, let's test if it can rebuild damaged documents. Here is a ribbed up paper with text on it. It is barely readable. Let me give it to Nanobanana Pro and ask, \"These torn paper fragments",

Here is a ribbed up paper with text on it. It is barely readable. Let me give it to Nanobanana Pro and ask, \"These torn paper fragments the full page. Preserve the handwriting style and fill only the missing connectors. Don't invent new sentences.\" And within seconds, it rebuilt the entire page, every word, every detail. This is insane for document recovery. The other three models couldn't even attempt this. They either generated gibberish, refused the task, or just created a completely new page that had nothing to do with the fragments. This is a feature unique to Nano Banana Pro right now. It's actually groundbreaking for archival work. But I got tired testing Nanobanana Pro and had some biscuits. That's when I had a crazy idea. I uploaded an image of the crumbled biscuit package into it, asking it to go back in time and fill the packet with biscuits. And look at that. It actually released time and filled it again. What a surprising feature. But let's bring this back to practical everyday use. Can it generate content that's not just pretty, but actually accurate and usable for real world applications? Education is the perfect test for this. Now let's see if it can take a simple photo and turn it into actual learning material. Let's take a basic Taj Mahal photo and ask it turn this photo into an informative visual explainer about the place. Look at that result. It has added labels, identified materials used, included the historical timeline of construction, perfectly readable. This is genuinely useful for teachers and students doing presentations. Chad GPT on the other hand created something decent, but dates were wrong. Cream 4.0 had layout issues. As for Nano Banana, the text was an unreadable mess. So far, Nano Banana Pro is killing it. But we're in a global world. If this is going to be the best image generator, it needs to handle any language perfectly. Now, here's the real test. Let's ask it to create a nearma washing powder high quality ad in Hindi. Let's see if it can align with this Indian brand's style, tone, and language. This is surprisingly good. Just look at that. It has accurately replicated the brand's tagline and logo. And here is the wild part. It matched the brand's marketing style by drawing comparison with competitors. The Hindi typography is flawless. No broken words and no spacing issues. Nano Banana failed this test completely. Cedream 4.0 is optimized for Chinese text, so it struggled with Hindi. Chad GPT got basic words right, but typography was messy. This is where Nano Banana Pro dominates. Next up, and this is actually cool. We're giving it a complex math problem and asking it to solve it like a tutor writing on a whiteboard. Clean handwriting, step-by-step breakdown. Can",

We're giving it a complex math problem and asking it to solve it like a tutor writing on a whiteboard. Clean handwriting, step-by-step breakdown. Can find out. And there we have it. Perfect handwritten solution. Every integral sign, every symbol, every step looks completely human written. The step-by-step progression is logical and mathematically sound. The handwriting looks completely natural. Every integral sign, every symbol, it genuinely looks like a person wrote this. But what's wild is it's not just solving the problem. It's actually teaching you. Like each step builds on the last one. You can follow the logic. This is how a good tutor would explain it. Now let me show you what the other models did. Total mess. Symbols are broken. The steps don't make sense. You couldn't learn from this. But Nano Banana Pro result is actually usable. You could genuinely learn calculus from this. All right, final test. Here's what I'm asking it to do. Write this sentence on the wall and rotate the camera 30\u00b0 left. I want to see if it copies it exactly or tries to fix it, sending it through. Okay, look at this. The text is on the wall. The camera angle shifted left. And here's the important part. Every single word is there in the exact order I gave it. It didn't try to make it. It just rendered what I asked for. The perspective looks right, too. The text follows the wall surface. It's not flat. It has depth. Now, let me check the other models. Nano Banana couldn't handle the camera rotation at all. Cedream 4.0 wrote the text but ignored the angle instruction. Chat GPT rearranged the words into something grammatically correct, which defeats the whole point. Nano Banana Pro followed the instruction exactly. That's spatial reasoning and text accuracy working together. So that's 10 tests. Nano Banana Pro won every single one. The other models have the strengths. Cream 4.0 is ridiculously fast at 1.8 seconds. Chat GPT has solid prompt understanding. Original Nano Banana still works fine for basic stuff. But when it comes to quality and features, Nano Banana Pro is clearly ahead. Google also released Gemini 3 Pro. We covered some mind-blowing use cases in that video that will genuinely put you ahead of 99% of people. I highly recommend you watch it if you want to stay ahead while everyone else is still figuring out the basics. Check link here or in links in the description.
