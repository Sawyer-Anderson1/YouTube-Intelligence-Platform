You put it online and you also pay Google and Facebook. You do not try and get free traffic like Wikipedia. You got to pay the man [laughter] because they control who gets the clicks. So, you pay them. You run your content in parallel with that. And you also optimize for what's called GEO. Now, you optimize for the AI engine so that your content is really helpful to the user in that engine. If you do those three things, you'll get all the users. They will give them to you. It's going somewhere. and just find that somewhere that it's going and do that and you'll be a billionaire in no time flesh.",
