It became really important to me to understand my Cat scan results before I talked to my doctor, because I felt like if I understood, I would be more of an active participant in my treatment. I want to track the growth of all of my tumors over time. Can you create a line graph for me and overlay my treatments? Absolutely. Let's get that visual going. I track all my symptoms. So I actually invented a metric called brightness, which was how much of myself am I feeling? What's wonderful about ChatGPT is that it can be that cumulative source of information. So we can make the best choices. Yeah, I think helping others is all about giving them the tools they need to help them heal. Because empowered patients get better health outcomes.",
