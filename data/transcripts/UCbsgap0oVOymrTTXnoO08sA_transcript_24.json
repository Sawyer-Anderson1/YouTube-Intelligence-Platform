        "text": " CES 2026. Day three had a very different energy compared to the first two days The big humanoid robots the industrial AI, the heavy autonomy stuff had already made their statements earlier in the week Day three shifted into something more subtle This was the day where you start seeing how AI, sensors batteries music and weird form factors actually slip into everyday objects Some of it felt practical Some of it felt strange Some of it felt like early category testing but across the board this was the day where CES really leaned into experimentation that could realistically ship One of the weirdest products to get real attention was something called Lollipop Star. On the surface it sounds like a joke It's literally a lollipop that plays music while you eat it But the way it works is actually interesting The candy uses bone conduction meaning sound vibrations travel through your teeth and jaw instead of through your ears As you bite down the vibrations move through your skull and your inner ear picks it up as sounds Each flavor is paired with specific music and the companies involved even licensed tracks for different versions Technically, it's simple but it shows how bone conduction keeps creeping into unexpected places It's cheap it's playful and it's very CES, but it also demonstrates how sensory teach keeps finding new surfaces Healthtech also had a strong showing and one of the more controversial examples was the Y brush At first glance it's just a fast toothbrush You bite down and it cleans all your teeth in about 20 seconds But the real angle is breath music analysis The brush includes sensors positioned near the nasal cavity that analyze compounds in your breath Those compounds correlate with markers related to gum disease metabolic music issues and other health signals The company was careful about how they framed it This isn't diagnosis It's music pattern detection The idea is to flag changes over time that might be worth paying attention to From a technical standpoint breath analysis has been around for years in labs Seeing it integrated into a consumer toothbrush is a sign of how sensors are shrinking and becoming cheap enough to embed anywhere Mental health and stress management showed up in a very CES way with a product called Thodian from Touchpoint Solution. music These are small clinton devices worn on opposite sides of the body They vibrate in alternating patterns when triggered by stress signals The system can work standalone but it becomes more powerful when paired with a wearable like an Apple Watch or Fitbit. If your heart rate spikes or your metrics suggest elevated stress the devices activate automatically music The vibration pattern is based on something called bilateral alternating stimulation tactile music feedback or blast This type of stimulation has been studied in therapy settings for calming the nervous system The interesting part is how this bridges clinical techniques into music consumer hardware even if",

That layered view of glucose sleep and activity is becoming a recurring theme across health techs Day three also leaned heavily into tools for work creators and productivity One standout was Magic Screen from a startup called Intricate. This is a snap-on touchscreen layer for MacBooks. It attach\u00e9s magnetically aligns with the display and connects via USBC. Once attached the Mac recognizes touch input and stylus input You can tape swipe pinch draw and even use pressure sensitive pen input Latency during demos looked extremely low almost on par with an iPad. The clever part is that the system preserves normal MacBook behavior including sleep detection when the lid closest It's a physical solution to something Apple has avoided for years and it works without deep OS modifications For creators one of the most impressive technical demos came from a partnership between OWC and a company called Strata. Their system allows remote video editing directly from files stored on a distant machine without uploading them to the cloud The files stay on local drives but the editor can drag them straight into a timeline and start cutting immediately even over poor network connections Playback and scrubbing remains smooth This relies on a patented virtual file access system that streams only what's needed in real time For teams working across countries this removes massive friction from collaboration and storage costs Display teach stayed experimental but practical Fryic introduced a voice controlled e in art frame You tap the frame speak a prompt and it generates an image using AI. The display uses e in Spectra i which allows full color without constant power draw Battery life is measured in years not hours The frame supports different orientations custom physical frames and local uploads without apply The voicetoart pipeline combines speechtoext",

These headphones look standard at first but they physically fold and twist into a portable speaker configuration The drivers reposition and the housing transforms into a speaker enclosure It's mechanically complex but it solves a real use case for people who want one device for personal listening and shared audio Mobility and EV adjacent products also filled the floor Nive showed the E-Wagon 4X, an electric powered cart designed to haul heavy gear while you ride It uses a 3000W motor a detachable govt battery and can carry over half a ton of payload It's aimed at production crews campers and industrial music use rather than casual consumers Steering, braking and stability were surprisingly refined for something that looks like a utility cart Segue introduced the Mayion eBike, a commuter focused electric bike with integrated tracking remote locking and Apple find my support It features a rear hub motor throttle assist and a claimed range up to 80 m depending on assist level The subscription-based tracking model reflects where microobility is heading blending hardware sales with ongoing services Strut showcased the EV1, a smart electric mobility chair that blends features of a wheelchair scooter and autonomous vehicle It includes a full sensor suite with cameras and LAR for obstacle avoidance Users can manually drive it or tap a location on a map and let it navigate autonomously The system can also follow you while walking which opens up interesting hybrid use cases Payload capacity speed and modular transport were all designed for dreamworld use rather than concept demos There was also plenty of CES style absurdity including liable luggage from Gyro. music It's exactly what it sounds like a",
