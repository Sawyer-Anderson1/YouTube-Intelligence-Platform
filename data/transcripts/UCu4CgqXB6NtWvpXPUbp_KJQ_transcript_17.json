So it's not going to be who has the most intelligence or the most resource. It's going to be who can care about the customer the most and make a product that serves that customer the best. And I hope that's the world that we go to. Because the open models become the tool. Right? And then you're able to wield your your sculpture, your creation, your task, your use case. You have to learn how to be a maker instead of a user. So you were able to take that open model and have it be specialized to your use case.",
