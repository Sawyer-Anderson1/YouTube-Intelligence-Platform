Meeting Agenda:
	General Discussion of the necessary first steps to be made, like the creation of the GitHub and Jira - all of which had been setup prior. Additionally the project proposal was discussed and a draft sent to Dr. Sarac. 
	We also discussed the next steps to be taken:
		- Research YouTube API
		- UI wireframes through Figma for next week
		- The Solution Design
	We then discussed the structure of the future meetings, being standups. And the general organization of the workflow in agile/Scrum.
	Questions asked:
		- question about the UI asked, about how static it should be, some dynamic elements that were proposed were like filtering time, etc.
		- question about the ROI and Budget. ROI is stuff like time saved for people and content creators to understand the trends/narratives.
			Budget should be zero, even though the API and LLMs have limits for free units/tokens.
	Then each member was asked about their roles, and their responsibilities were made clear to each.
